If you look at the cover you see one of your defeated foes. Trapped in the picture, but not in time like other models. Your enemy is very much alive and looking at you with a pleading expression. How you would like to play with her, a petite twenty something with red hair and green eyes, covered in the most exquisite bondage equipment you could imagine. But the strangest thing happens when you open up the magazine. Before you can even look at the first page a wave of magic flows through you. When you open the page you are astonished anew seeing and reading about a bondage session with you and your “bondage kitten” from your submissive foe\u0027s perspective. Even pictures are provided, for every highlight of your “session”. Reading about it makes you wish you could play with your “bondage kitten” yourself. Yet every time you read the stories inside you have a slight déjà vu as if as you already know what happens. At the end, when you close the magazine, you are greeted by your bondage kitten who seems now to be quite satisfied. It saddens you that the magic of the magazine takes some time to recharge but reading about these sessions manages to lift your spirit every time.","PortraitUrl":"bondage_magazine_Meddle.png","MoneyValue":50.00,"MoneyValueSell":0.00,"ItemType":"consumable_reuseable","UseCooldown":40,"UsageMessage_Item":null,"UsageMessage_Player":null,"Findable":false,"FindWeight":0,"GivesEffect":null,"IsUnique":false,"CurseTFFormdbName":null,"HealthBonusPercent":0.00,"ManaBonusPercent":0.00,"ExtraSkillCriticalPercent":0.00,"HealthRecoveryPerUpdate":0.00,"ManaRecoveryPerUpdate":0.00,"SneakPercent":0.00,"EvasionPercent":0.00,"EvasionNegationPercent":0.00,"MeditationExtraMana":0.00,"CleanseExtraHealth":0.00,"MoveActionPointDiscount":0.00,"SpellExtraTFEnergyPercent":0.00,"SpellExtraHealthDamagePercent":0.00,"CleanseExtraTFEnergyRemovalPercent":0.00,"SpellMisfireChanceReduction":0.00,"SpellHealthDamageResistance":0.00,"SpellTFEnergyDamageResistance":0.00,"ExtraInventorySpace":0.00,"Discipline":0,"Perception":0,"Charisma":0,"Submission_Dominance":0,"Fortitude":0,"Agility":0,"Allure":0,"Corruption_Purity":0,"Magicka":0,"Succour":0,"Luck":0,"Chaos_Order":0,"InstantHealthRestore":0.00,"InstantManaRestore":0.00,"ReuseableHealthRestore":32.00,"ReuseableManaRestore":0.00},{"Id":49,"dbName":"item_sparkly_cocktail_dress_Haretia","FriendlyName":"Sparkly Cocktail Dress","Description":"Your very own sparkly cocktail-dress, designed to catch everyone’s eyes with its decorative gems.

[Desc]               <blue>The announcer introduces the next contestant,  a skinny, nerdy looking highschooler named Jimmy Stoddert. At a request from the announcer, he explains why he came on the show: The most popular girl in his school, Tiffany Delaney, promised him a date if he wins. The camera pans to a beautiful blonde girl in the front row, who smiles sweetly and yells loudly enough for the mics to pick up, "I can't believe you fell for that lie! It was just to get you on this dumb show so we can point and laugh when you get turned into a calculator! You'll be more popular that way!" Ouch. That's got to hurt. From the look on his face, though, he seems less crushed and more determined to prove her wrong. He won't be an easy opponent, either. Smart, analytical, and with reflexes honed from years of videogames in his downtime, the only chance you have is that he has little experience. Once things start getting strange or sexy (or on this show, both), you bet he'll get distracted real quick.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>As the final transformation takes place, Tracey blinks in confusion. "What? I lost? But if I lost, then why do I feel so great?" She must be feeling pretty great, as she's now a gorgeous blonde cheerleader with an amazing figure, killer face, and cheerful disposition. She's the kind of girl who would be the top figure in any school. Tiffany shouts "What's WRONG with you, you freak? Is this how you always wanted to end up?" Tracey just replies, "Calm down, Tiffany. Honestly, you're so uptight. Why do you hate me so much anyway? Is it because I'm hotter than you? Or because I'm more popular?" What do you mean, more opopular?!" Tiffany seems besides herself with rage. "You're an ugly loser nerd! I don't care what you look like or how big your tits are!" Tracey just sighs and says, "What ev errrrr. Is it because you think I stole your guy? You can have the head quarterback, he's kind of a jerk anyway. You two will get along great." The implication that Tracey is doing Tiffany a FAVOR by giving up the QB seems to be enough to push her over the edge. She screams and rushes the stage, tackling Tracey. They wrestle for a few moments, in which the athletic Tracey seems to have the distinct upper hand, before an explosion of golden light throws them apart. "Tracey, why don't you go and have a seat in the front row?" the host says. "What about me?" asks Tiffany. When she tries to follow Tracey, a ring of the same golden light pops into existence briefly, forcing her to stay near the podium. The host ignores her, and instead turns to the crowd. "Ladiessss and gentlemen! We've just had one volunteer step up to the podium for the next round! Do I have another?!"</pink>;

[tgShade]            shoes 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Jimmy's shoes suddenly seem to contract around his feet. It looks like it should be painful, but as he watches with a look of surprise and not pain, you realize his feet must be shrinking as well. Suddenly, the color and material shifts to fake black leather, and the shoes surge up and over his ankle, leaving him wearing a pair of dainty boots that look like part of some sort of uniform. He just looks on in confusion, but Tiffany takes the opportunity to shout out "You MUST tell me where you got those!" from the audience before falling into cackling laugher.;

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Jimmy is skinny to the point of skeletal.;
[short]               skinny frame;
[tgShade]            body 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Jimmy looks on in amazement as his skin begins to tan. It's still not exactly dark, but it's no longer a deathly, sun-fearing pallor, either.;
[status]               Jimmy is still grossly skinny, but at least he doesn't look like a corpse any more.;
[short]               skinny frame;
[tgShade]            body 25;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Jimmy smiles and says "Yeah!" as visible muscle tone forms all over his body. He looks quite good, now. The cameras cut to a shot of Tiffany scowling and rolling her eyes.;
[status]               Jimmy has a toned, attractive frame.;
[short]               toned body;
[tgShade]            body 50;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Jimmy abruptly begins to shrink, losing several inches of height. His new muscle tone seems to fade, too, though only slightly - you suspect it's still there, under the skin. Tiffany calls out "Shrimp!" from the audience, but Jimmy mostly seems confused as to why everything is now bigger.;
[status]               Jimmy has a smaller, sleeker body.;
[short]               slim body;
[tgPoint]            body;
[tgShade]            body 75;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Jimmy begins to shrink again, this time mostly in his torso. As he finishes, leaving him with a slim, girlish figure, he looks out over the audience and says "Tiffany, I think I'm about the same height as you are..." Tiffany seems too shocked by the sudden comparison to insult him back.;
[status]               Jimmy has a slim, girlish figure. ;
[short]               girlish figure;
[tgShade]            body 100;

[FACE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your opponent has a bony face with traces of acne - both scars from the past and a few red spots active now. His glasses distort his eyes enough to make it hard to tell the color, but you're fairly certain it's a muddy brown. A slightly crooked nose and too-thin, chapped lips complete the package.;
[short]               nerdy, bony face;
[tgShade]            face 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               The skin on his seems to shimmer as years of acne scars and grease fade away. It's now smooth and rather attractive. Too bad about what the skin is covering. ;
[status]               Your opponent's face is still bony and rather ugly, but at least he has nice clear skin;
[short]               bony face;
[tgShade]            face 20;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               The changes this time are rather extreme. His faces rounds out slightly even as his nose shrinks a bit to a more balanced size. Even glasses seem to thin and become more fashionable, revealing bright brown eyes. The final result is actually quite attractive. Jimmy looks in one of the mirrors provided, and seems to agree, as he says "Hey, not bad..." in his $VOICE$ ;
[status]               Your opponent now has a surprisingly attractive face, with clear skin and a strong chin.;
[short]               handsome face;
[tgShade]            face 40;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your opponent's face begins to transform again. His cheekbones rise, even as his face rounds out more. His lips swell, and his nose shrinks. Even his slight stubble fades away. The result is androgynous, shading to feminine. He looks nervously in the mirror, and in his $VOICE$ asks, "What is this? What's going on?";
[status]               Your opponent has a slightly girlish face, and this fact seems to bother him. Hardly surprising, given that just a few minutes ago he thought he as turning into a hunk.;
[short]               slightly girly face;
[tgPoint]            face;
[tgShade]            face 60;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Jimmy has been squinting ever since he lost his glasses, but now he blinks in surprise and says "What the heck? I can see again?" You soon realize why, as his blinking stops to reveal bright blue eyes. His eyelashes grow out, and even his eyes themselves grow slightly in size, leaving him with a beautiful, innocent look. He soon spots this in a mirror, and a look of anger crosses his face. Of course, things being how they are, it just gives him a cute pout.;
[status]               Jimmy sports a slightly girly face, except for his beautifully clear blue eyes, surrounded by long curly lashes, that would not look out of place on a supermodel.;
[short]               slightly girly face;
[tgShade]            face 80;
[WaitFor]           accessory 1;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               "What? My face again? What now?" Jimmy sighs, in his $VOICE$. His question is soon answered as his cheekbone push further out, his lips swell even more, and his nose shrinks to a pert button. The result is gorgeous, and if that wasn't enough, his lips suddenly turn pink with lipgloss. "What the hell is that?" shouts an angry voice from the audience. Tiffany doesn't seem any happier than Jimmy.;
[status]               Jimmy has the kind of face usually described with single words. Words like "Angelic" and "Innocent." And, also, "Gorgeous" and "Beautiful" and "Sexy.";
[short]               sweet, girly face;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Jimmy's voice is, surprisingly, not nasally and high pitched, but rather scratchy and low-pitched. Still not pleasant to listen to, though.;
[short]               scratchy voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Jimmy begins to cough violently. When he finishes, he says "Excuse me" only to jump at the sound of his own voice - now rich and deep. "Wow! Is that me?" he says appreciatively.;
[status]               Jimmy has a rich, deep voice.;
[short]               rich voice;
[tgShade]            voice 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Jimmy coughs again, and when he speaks to test out the new change, he gets a shock - it's gone up in pitch quite a bit! Tiffany laughs cruelly from the audience, and you notice that the TV crew has given her a mic for commentary as she says "Haha, that's what your voice should sound like, dweeb. All high and nasally.";
[status]               Jimmy has a high pitched voice.;
[short]               high pitched voice;
[tgPoint]            voice;
[tgShade]            voice 66;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Jimmy clears his throat several times, and when he speaks, his voice has again jumped in pitch. Now it's high, sweer, and girly, with just a hint of tease. Tiffany weighs in with "Hahaha, what the hell is with your voice?" but it falls rather flat as an insult, not least because it makes it clear that Jimmy's new voice is prettier than Tiffany's!;
[status]               Jimmy has a high, melodious voice, with just a hint of tease.;
[short]               sweet, melodious voice;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Jimmy wears a pair of dress pants and a belt. He clearly tried to dress up for TV.;
[short]               dress pants;
[tgShade]            pants 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Jimmy's dress pants abruptly roughen and turn blue, leaving him wearing a pair of jeans for a more casual look.;
[status]               Jimmy is wearing a pair of nice jeans.;
[short]               jeans;
[tgShade]            pants 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Jimmy's jeans roll up his legs, until he's wearing a pair of short denim shorts. "Jorts!" calls out Tiffany gleefully, but as the bottoms fray, it becomes clear they're more like cutoff jeans.;
[status]               Jimmy is wearing a pair of short shorts. They show off his $LEGS$;
[short]               short shorts;
[tgPoint]            pants;
[tgShade]            pants 66;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Jimmy's pants transform again, billowing out into a thigh length skirt. The color changes to bright orange, with black trim. "What the hell? That's our school colors! What are you playing at, nerd?" Tiffany asks from the audience;
[status]               Jimmy is wearing a short skirt in black and orange, apparently his school colors. It emphasizes, more than covers, his $BUTT$ and $LEGS$;
[short]               short skirt;

[WAIST];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Jimmy has just a faint gut on his $BODY$;
[short]               faint gut;
[tgShade]            waist 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Jimmy's waist firms slightly, no longer pushing out his $SHIRT$.;
[status]               Jimmy has a toned, firm waist. You suspect that under the $SHIRT$ he wears there might even be a hint of abs.;
[short]               toned waist;
[tgShade]            waist 50;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               "Whoah!" Jimmy exclaims, his hands reaching downwards to feel his waist. It's clear why, as it caves inward, leaving a thin waist with a toned, flat stomach.;
[status]               Jimmy has a thin, girlish waist and a toned, flat stomach.;
[short]               thin, toned stomach;

[ACCESSORY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               A pair of glasses adorn Jimmy's face.;
[short]               glasses;
[tgShade]            accessory 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Jimmy's glasses suddenly fall of his face for no apparent reason. He tries to catch them, but they seem to tangle in his fingers. After a bit of fumbling, he pulls his hands apart with a confused look on his face. Instead of glasses, he now sports a charm bracelet on one wrist and a variety of silvery rings on his fingers.;
[status]               Jimmy has a charm bracelet on one wrist and several cute rings on his $HANDS$;
[short]               jewelry;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Jimmy has stubby, boney hands, though they at least seem well muscled from hours of video games. ;
[short]               bony hands;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Jimmy's hands firm slightly with muscle.;
[status]               Jimmy has firm hands, the kind businessmen swear by in a handshake.;
[short]               hands;
[tgShade]            hands 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Jimmy's hands slim and shrink at the same time, leaving him with long, thing fingers on dainty hands. He holds them up, looking confused as to just what is happening.;
[status]               Jimmy has long, thing fingers on small hands.;
[short]               long, thin hands;
[tgPoint]            hands;
[tgShade]            hands 66;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Jimmy's hands shrink a little more as he holds them up and watches in fascination. The real change, however, comes as the hair disappears and his nails grow out from his skin, before abruptly shading a bright orange. "OOoh, where did you find that shade?" Tiffany calls out in a mocking tone. Jimmy doesn't answer, just continues to stare at his new, girly hands.;
[status]               Jimmy has small, girly hands with bright orange nails.;
[short]               girly hands;

[BREASTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Jimmy's chest is flat and bony, in as much as you can tell through his $SHIRT$;
[short]               flat bony chest;
[tgShade]            breasts 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               "Oh, hey!" Jimmy says in surprise, as his $SHIRT$ tightens slightly across his chest. You can see just enough shape to know he now has some muscle definition.;
[status]               Jimmy has a decently muscled chest. Not anything like a body builder, but at least enough that he doesn't look like a scarecrow anymore.;
[short]               firmly muscled chest;
[tgShade]            breasts 20;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               "Please be more muscles!" Jimmy says, as his chest begins to stretch against $SHIRT$. They don't grow much, but something seems off about the shape. They seem a little too pointy, the tips pushing out a little too much. It's Tiffany who is the first to realize the truth. "Hahaha, no way. Is that a pair of little titties?" Jimmy looks down in shock as it becomes apparent she's right. He goes to gently poke one, only to pull back his finger with a faint yelp the second it touches.;
[status]               Jimmy has a tiny pair of boobs, just visible as they push against his $SHIRT$. From the frequent glances downwards, they seem to be bothering him quite a bit.;
[short]               tiny boobs;
[tgPoint]            breasts;
[tgShade]            breasts 40;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               "Oh, no, not again!" Jimmy says. You soon see what he meant, as his tiny breasts begin to swell. He reaches up to push against them with his $HANDS$, but it's a futile gesture. Indeed, it only seems to make things worse, as the growing nipples rub against his palms through his $SHIRT$. His face turns red with embarrassment and, you think, something else, and he jerks his hands away like they're on fire. His $FACE$ blushing crimson, he murmurs "The... they're sensitive..." Tiffany can barely speak with laughter, but she manages to get out "Oh, I can't wait for our date, Mr. Hunk...";
[status]               A pair of full, perky B-cups sit on Jimmy's chest, hard nipples visibly poking through his $SHIRT$. They seem to be on his mind, as every once in a while he'll reach up and gently rub one, only to blush and remove his hand when he remembers where he is.;
[short]               perky B-cup breasts;
[tgShade]            breasts 60;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Jimmy lets out a soft moan in his $VOICE$ as his chest grows once again. He doesn't try to fight it this time - instead, from his moans, he seems to be enjoying it. Tiffany laughs and calls out "More tits?" but goes quiet as they continue to grow, the nipples visible through his $SHIRT$ swelling to the size of dimes. Finally, two heavy, round breasts hang off of his chest, though they hardly seem to sag at all. "Oh, wow..." is all that Jimmy can say, but Tiffany has enough shock and anger for the both of them. "WHY are HIS breasts bigger than MINE?";
[status]               Jimmy is now the proud owner of two round D-cups that sit high on his chest, striving against gravity with the defiance of youth. The bounce visibly every time he makes any sudden movement, and while he seem to have become demure enough to not touch them constantly, the large nipples that visibly tent the fabric of his $SHIRT$ prove that they're just as sensitive and aroused as his before.;
[short]               bouncy D-cup breasts;
[tgShade]            breasts 80;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Jimmy's breasts suddenly seems to quiver and fill out just a tiny bit more. It's only when you realize his nipples are no longer visible that you know that a bra just formed over his chest. The audience audibly sighs in disappoint. Jimmy blushes, but also giggles and shouts "Soooorry, but I don't go showing these off to just anyone.";
[status]               Jimmy's large D cup breasts strain his $SHIRT$. Now that a bra has formed, the nipples no longer show and they seem to bounce much less. Much less... but still a little. They're too big to be restrained entirely.;

[WaitFor]           mind 4;

[BUTT];
[STAGE] 0;

[tgShade]            butt 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Jimmy yelps and grabs his bottom. When he removes his $HANDS$, you can see that it now fills out his $PANTS$ nicely.;
[status]               Jimmy has a toned, firm ass. Quite attractive, if you're into that sort of thing.;
[short]               toned butt;
[tgShade]            butt 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Jimmy claps his $HANDS$ to his bottom again. This time, though, it isn't his ass that expands, but his hips. He, and you and the audience, gape in amazement as they push the sides of his $PANTS$ outwards. Soon they're wide and feminine. Jimmy looks at them, confused and worried, while Tiffany catcalls from the audience.;
[status]               Jimmy has a firm, if not very large, butt and wide hips that push out the sides of his $PANTS$;
[short]               wide hips;
[tgPoint]            butt;
[tgShade]            butt 66;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Jimmy suddenly bends over slightly and begins to rub his firm ass, moaning slightly as he does. Everyone stares, quiet except for Tiffany's laughter, as his butt begins to swell, visibly tenting out his $PANTS$ until they almost no longer cover it. Tiffany's laughter dies off into horrified silence at the sight of the beautiful round ass Jimmy now possesses. For his part, Jimmy just smiles sheepishly before pulling his hands away - but not without a final squeeze.;
[status]               Jimmy has a round, firm ass that's almost too big for his $PANTS$ to cover. This doesn't seem to bother him in the least, and you notice he seems to be finding more excuses to bend over slightly, with his butt towards the audience.;

[LEGS];

[tgShade]            legs 33;

[tf]               Jimmy's legs begin to transform again. First they seem to lose some muscle tone, though they still have a strong, athletic look. Then they lengthen a little bit, stretching and firming. Jimmy looks briefly happy to have an inch or two of height back, but then his thighs begin to swell. The end result are curvy, sexy legs well shown off by his $PANTS$.;

From his despairing moans, it doesn't seem to help. Then the tenor of his moans seems to change slightly, as he rubs more slowly and deeply, before abruptly looking up and remembering he's on television. As he jerks his $HANDS$ away, he blushes bright red.;

He's drawing some vowels out a little, and ending sentences on a slightly higher pitch. It's quite girly.;

You get a clear answer as you notice his body language change, as he rests one of his $HANDS$ on his hip. Tiffany speaks up from the audience, "What, are you gay now?" Jimmy replies "No, but who cares if I was? You're such a catty asshole. That's why all the girls at school gossip about you behind your back, you know?" Tiffany is so taken aback by this remark that she can't even manage a reply before the next game starts.;

[tf]               Jimmy reaches up to scratch his head as his hair grows down to his shoulders, lightening to a nice shade of chestnut as it goes. The faint sheen of grease disappears, leaving a softer, less gross, shine. He shrugs and says, "Guess I'll need a haircut.";

He reaches up absently to brush one away, but ends up twirling it in his fingers instead. "No way, no way, I'm not a blonde...." he says, distinct notes of disbelief and fear in his $VOICE$.;

The sleeves roll up his $ARMS$ and the neckline dips, allowing a just a little view of the top of his $BREASTS$.  It seems to shrink a little, clinging to his $BODY$ better, and the white color slowly darkens to a pastel orange. "This looks like a girl's shirt" he says, his $VOICE$ confused.;

The neckline dips again, and the bottom rolls up, displaying his $WAIST$ to his horror and Tiffany's amusement. Finally, the fabric on the front seems to writhe and shift before settling into a logo - the "Tammany Hall Tigers," with a roaring tiger head displayed front and center. "What the hell?" Jimmy asks. His $VOICE$ continues, "That's our school's crest...";

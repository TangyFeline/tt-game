[Desc]               <blue>To your surprise, you recognize Silver--he was a big-time investor back in the day, the kind who showed up on magazine covers. He lost most of his fortune in bad investments years ago, and you haven't heard much about him since.

 He still dresses well, his gray suit neatly pressed and his graying hair combed back, but his face is now wrinkled, and his shoulders stoop slightly. He almost looks too old and frail to be here, but the wicked glint in his eye tells you he's not to be underestimated.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>You're not sure what happened to the warped mass that used to be Silver. One rumor holds that she was sold to a rich pervert for use as a living toy. Another claims that she's now kept in the same facility and room as her former wife, the two monsters endlessly teasing and stroking each other to mutual orgasm. Whatever happened, the show's organizers are keeping mum about it.

 They were afraid at first that Silver's transformation would provoke an outcry, as they hadn't previously televised any changes that extreme. But reruns of the episode received very high ratings, and they soon relaxed their screening rules to allow in more bizarre transformees--not regularly, just as an occasional treat. The audiences are happy, the producers are happy, and even the losers are probably okay with their new lives. At least, they wouldn't say otherwise if you asked them.</pink>;

[status]               His skin is pale and bloodless.;
[short]               light orange nipples;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               At first, you think Silver is blushing. But the slight red tint to his skin is spreading across his whole body.;
[status]               His skin is slightly reddened.;
[short]               reddened nipples;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Silver's skin turns a rich shade of red, just slightly lighter than the red in his eyes.;
[status]               His skin is a rich red color.;
[short]               dark red nipples;
[WaitFor]           face 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Silver's skin lightens to the orange-red of a house on fire, contrasting pleasantly with the darker red of his eyes. You wonder just how hot he would be to the touch.;
[status]               His skin is the orange-red color of a house on fire.;
[short]               fiery nipples;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               All the skin below Silver's neck completely drains of color, looking sickly pale. Strangely, her face gets noticeably redder.;
[status]               Her skin is a sickly white, save for her bright red face.;
[short]               colorless nipples;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;

[FACE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               His face bears the lines of want and worry. His eyes are dark brown, deeply sunken in his face.;
[short]               the gaps in his teeth;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               The lines begin to fade from Silver's face, and the space around his eyes no longer looks so hollowed. He's getting younger.;
[status]               He still has a few wrinkles, but he's looking younger.;
[short]               his shiny white teeth;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               As the last lines fade from Silver's face, a vein bursts in his left eye. Blood pools in a ring that swallows the white and the iris, leaving only a black pupil that swallows all light. You look to his right eye to find it reversed, a blood-red pupil surrounded by blackness.

 Silver grimaces, revealing sharpened fangs. "You're glowing," he says in $VOICE$. "I can see that now. Your sins haven't blackened the light from your soul. It . . burns me . . ." He visibly takes control of himself. "I'll just have to snuff it out.";
[status]               His eyes are mismatched, one red with a black pupil and the other black with a red pupil. His smile shows sharpened fangs.;
[short]               his jagged fangs;

[WaitFor]           voice 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Silver's face grows rounder, its edges and angles softening. He doesn't look quite so intimidating now, though the eyes and the fangs still give you pause.;
[status]               His eyes are mismatched, one red with a black pupil and the other black with a red pupil. His smile shows sharpened fangs.;
[short]               his jagged fangs;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               As Silver's face rounds further, he moans in $VOICE$, revealing fangs that are beginning to go dull. These points aren't made to tear through flesh, but to run along it or press teasingly against it. He closes his eyes and pulls his cheeks inwards, and you realize he's sucking on an imaginary cock.

 He shakes his head, sending his $HAIR$ flying. The glint reappears in his mismatched eyes. "I won't let myself be distracted that easily.";
[status]               His eyes are mismatched, one red with a black pupil and the other black with a red pupil. His fangs have ggone dull.;
[short]               his blunted fangs;
[WaitFor]           voice 4;
[WaitFor]           hair 4;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Silver's face is now completely feminine, with rounded eyes and plump, pouting lips. He stares at the images of himself on the screen above, not with shock, but with resignation. "I look like her," he says quietly, "before she grew ill.";
[status]               His eyes are mismatched, one red with a black pupil and the other black with a red pupil. His plump, pouting lips hang open slightly, showing his dulled fangs.;
[short]               his dulled fangs;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Silver licks his lips. Then, experimentally, he pushes his tongue out farther and farther. He easily touches it to the tip of his nose. Then he moves it around in complicated patterns, testing its flexibility--it seems he can control it almost as well as his tail.

 He draws it back into his mouth, and to your surprise, he laughs. "My wife certainly couldn't do THAT.";
[status]               His eyes are mismatched, one red with a black pupil and the other black with a red pupil. His plump, pouting lips hang open slightly, showing his dulled fangs.;

[WaitFor]           butt 4;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               Silver lets her mouth hang open, running her tongue along the inside. Her teeth have vanished into her gums.

 She begins to speak, but without teeth, it takes you a moment to realize what she's saying. "I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm not scared . . .";
[status]               Her eyes are mismatched, one red with a black pupil and the other black with a red pupil. Her plump, pouting lips hang open slightly, revealing that she's completely toothless.;

[WaitFor]           voice 6;
[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               Silver's nose melts like wax, reforming into a little round button that's swollen with blood. Absently, she extends her tongue and licks it, and she jumps in the air in shock. It seems to be quite sensitive.;
[status]               Her eyes are mismatched, one red with a black pupil and the other black with a red pupil. Her nose has melted into a little round button, and she can only breathe through her mouth.;

[STAGE] 9;
[tf]               Silver looks skyward and closes her eyes for the last time. They seal shut, leaving behind no sign they were ever there. Her neck melts into her torso, leaving her head balanced directly on her shoulders, facing up.

"I don't need my eyes to see now," she says. "Your light is still shining. Guard it. Don't let it go out like mine did."

 A great deal of the audience is starting to be creeped out. A few are even booing. But the rest are still entranced.;
[status]               Her head balances directly on her neck, facing upwards. She no longer has eyes, but she still has a mouth.;

[STAGE] 10;
[tf]               Silver's head begins to melt and lose definition. She struggles to get out her final words.

 "Eva wanted to be beautiful again," she says, "like she was before she grew ill. She wanted to be sexy. No, she wanted to be sex itself. Instead, she became a monster. But was she really so different from-- "

 She gags on a spurt of precum that flows up out of her mouth. Before she can force the rest of it out, her lips lose definition and reshape, turning sideways to match the orientation of what used to be her nose. You're not sure whether they're another pussy, or simply an opening for the cockhead her head is becoming. Perhaps they're something in between.

 Silver's ejaculation covers the area around her, drowning her warped form in a deluge of cum. After a full minute, she stops twitching and lies perfectly still. 

 "Hell yeah!" an audience member shouts. "That was awesome!";
[status]               Silver's face is completely gone, replaced by a cockhead;

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               He's wearing a fine gray suit. It's been neatly pressed. 

He was probably muscular once, but time has clearly ravaged him.;
[short]               wasting frame;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Muscles ripple underneath Silver's suit. He unbuttons his coat, then unfastens a few buttons of his undershirt for good measure. "Ah, that's better," he says.;
[status]               He's wearing a fine gray suit. He's loosened a few buttons.

 He's beginning to look more muscular.;
[short]               muscular frame;
[WaitFor]           shoulders 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Silver chokes, his tie cutting tightly into his bulging neck. His $HANDS$ rush to remove it, and he casts it aside with a curse. He then tries to unbutton his undershirt, but isn't fast enough to keep a button from popping off as his chest swells with muscle.

 He stops unbuttoning about halfway down, giving you a good view of the thick black hair on his chest. "You've gotten this much from me," he says, "but no more. I'll end it here.";
[status]               He's wearing a fine gray suit. His undershirt is unbuttoned halfway down, giving you a good view of the thick black hair on his chest.;
[short]               burly frame;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               By the tail end of that last round, Silver already knew he'd lost, and he focused his efforts on unbuttoning his undershirt the rest of the way. He was just in time as he put on even more bulk. His shirt looks more like a vest now, barely fitting on his massive frame.

 Surprisingly, his pants still fit him. Maybe he buys from the same store as Bruce Banner. Still, he lets out an audible sigh of relief as he removes and casts aside his belt. Then he glares at you. "Why do you persist? Do you think you have any hope against me?";
[status]               He's wearing a fine gray suit. It's completely unbuttoned, and he's removed his belt as well, trying to create space for his expanding build.;
[short]               enormous frame;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Your win staggered Silver harder than you expected. His body rapidly loses mass, and the hair on his chest completely fades away. His shirt now fits him better, but he doesn't rebutton it, letting it hang from him like an open jacket.

 Looking him over, you realize he's still in good shape. He's simply gone from a wrestler's build to a runner's, his body lean and fit. He could pass for a man of twenty if he so chose.;
[status]               He's wearing a fine gray suit. Although it fits him, it's completely unbuttoned, and he's removed his belt as well.

 His body is lean but fit, like a runner.;

[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Silver's pants fall down as his body shrinks in on itself, giving you an unobstructed view of his $GROIN$. He asks for a break to find the belt he threw aside earlier, now necessary to keep his clothes on.

 Though smaller than before, Silver looks no weaker or frailer--it's like his strength is a spring, and you just compacted it. His shirt hangs loosely on him, but you can still get a good view of his $BREASTS$.;
[status]               He's wearing a fine gray suit that's too large for him. It's completely unbuttoned.

 His body is lean but fit, like a runner.;

[WaitFor]           groin 4;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Silver reaches over his shoulder to scratch an itch near the top of his wings. Then he scratches lower . . . lower . . . He doesn't bother to move his arm around to his side, casually arching his back at an unbelievable angle to reach the bottom of his wings. "Ah," that's better," he says.;
[status]               He's wearing a fine gray suit, completely unbuttoned. It's too large for him, and his shirt and coat hang loosely over his $BREASTS$.

 He's unbelievably flexible, casually bending and contorting his body.;

[WaitFor]           shoulders 4;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               Silver's coat bursts into flame. This doesn't seem to bother her at all, and she waits calmly for it to burn away to nothing, taking her undershirt with it. Her torso is completely bare, but she makes no attempt to cover her $CUSTOM1$, standing tall and proud to let the audience see her body clearly.;
[status]               Her torso is bare, but she still wears the ripped remnants of her pants.

 She's unbelievably flexible, casually bending and contorting her body.;

[WaitFor]           mind 3;

[tf]               Silver's pants burn away to nothing, and she stands completely naked before you. Her erection is unabated.;
[status]               All of her clothing has burned away.

 She's unbelievably flexible, casually bending and contorting her body.;
[short]               small frame;
[STAGE] 9;
[tf]               Silver's body compacts inwards and round out, while her head seems to widen. She no longer has distinct shoulders--her torso and head have become a single rounded pillar.;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               His voice might have been authoritative once, but he can't keep it from trembling.;
[short]               a frail voice;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Silver lifts his $HANDS$ to cover his mouth as he coughs repeatedly. "Ah, that's much better," he says in a rumbling baritone.;
[status]               His voice is deep and rumbling.;
[short]               a rumbling voice;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Silver sputters so strongly you fear he may have a heart attack. He waves off the host's attempt to approach him. "I'm all right," he says.

That can't be Silver speaking, can it? A voice that deep doesn't belong in a human throat. He sounds like something off a death metal record that's been pitch-shifted.

 He smirks at you, showing you $FACE$. "There was a time when men and women ran to and fro at the sound of my voice. Now they'll at least run away.";
[status]               His voice is inhumanly deep.;
[short]               an inhumanly deep voice;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Silver looks confused. "Did something happen? Wait, my voice . . ." It's still pretty deep, but he at least sounds human now.;
[status]               His voice is still deep, but it sounds more human now.;
[short]               a deep voice;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Silver lets out a moan--not the brassy sound you were expecting, but a more husky tone, androgynous tone. "How can it feel so good?" he asks, seemingly to himself. "To lose yourself piece by piece--why is it so addictive?";
[status]               His voice is husky and androgynous. ;
[short]               a husky voice;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Silver coughs slightly. "Testing, testing . . ." His voice has become a smoky contralto, feminine in timbre, but deeper than any woman's voice you've ever heard. It's surprisingly seductive.

 "I preferred the harsher voice," Silver admits, "but this is good, too. I imagine it must be hard to resist orders given in a voice like this." He smirks at you. "Wouldn't you enjoy taking my orders? Just let your shots fly a little slower, and take a little longer to make your guesses . . .";
[status]               His voice is a smoky contralto.;
[short]               a smoky voice;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Silver's voice catches in her throat, and she coughs repeatedly. When it comes out again, it's strained, like she's having trouble speaking at all.

 "I don't know how much longer I'll be able to talk," she says. "But I can at least show you what I can't tell you.";
[status]               Her voice is strained, and she seems to be having trouble speaking.;

 There's a moment of silence in the audience. Then someone starts to cheer, and others soon join in.

 "There's nothing left in you jackals, is there?" Silver calls out. "Nothing but lust and schadenfreude. But there has to be someone left who understands."

 No such announcement comes.

 Silver laughs. "Do you know why I invested so much money in transformation research? It was supposed to be a last-ditch medical treatment--one my Eva desperately needed.

 With one hand, Silver holds her shirt open, while with the other, she lifts her right breast closer to her mouth. She lowers her head and begins to lick at it, toying with the nipple with her inhumanly long tongue. Then she switches breasts and repeats the process, lost in a trance.

 Silver loosens her belt and drops her pants, her erection standing tall and proud. She no longer has balls, and you have an unobstructed view of the glistening wet mound below her cock. Without bending her knees, she contorts her back until her mouth is close enough to her cock to wrap around it. The spines bend at her touch, and you realize that they've gone blunt like her claws, now meant for pleasure instead of pain.

 She tongues his way to a sloppy orgasm, then licks her penis clean, savoring the taste of her cum. Then she lets her tongue roam even lower, loudly and messily eating herself out.

 The host makes a loud throat-clearing noise, and Silver realizes she's out of time. She puts her pants back on and returns to the podium, smiling all the way. "I taste like fine red wine," she tells you. "After I win, I'll let you take a lick or two--assuming you still have a tongue.";

Still clad in the torn remnants of Luke Silver's clothing, she prances and sways for the audience's entertainment, doing her best to make sure none of the audience take their eyes off her. Yet she still seems largely lucid, and she's clearly capable of playing more.

 The host calls her aside, whispering into her ear for a very long time while she stands silently, looking almost bored. When the host is done, she doesn't bother to respond to him, instead staring out into the audience as she speaks.

 "The host wants me to forfeit. The poor fellow's quite insistent on it, actually, saying the psychological screening should have kept me out, and the show can't be held responsible for what may happen if I keep playing.

 But I've spent years trying to run from destiny, and it's long past time I faced it head on. I won't forfeit. I'll win the game, along with enough money to start over, or I'll face the same fate Eva met. All of you in the audience, watch closely. I can promise you one hell of a show either way."

 She picks the diamond ring up off the ground and kisses it one last time, then throws it into the audience. You don't see where it lands. Then she turns to you with a wicked smile. "Bring it on, you latter-day gladiator. Show me what you're truly made of.";

 Silver smirks. "I remember a time when this sort of show would have been called indecent. But there's no such thing as indecency left in the world now, is there? Anything and everything is appropriate, so long as it's performed on stage in front of a cheering crowd. You'll find out what I mean when you realize what you're becoming.";

[Desc]               <pink>Kara is an nineteen-year-old freckled redhead, a short five foot two, slim bodied yet quite fit young ranchgirl.  She has a straw hat resting on her head, frayed and sunbleached, covering up her short hair in its entirety.  She is dressed wearing a pair of jeans with holes worn through at the knees, not by any sense of fashion but by actual hard use and age from a life on her adopted family's ranch.  She wears a faded pink t-shirt with the image of two horses trotting through a field with a muscular male centaur at the head of the trio.  <br><br>She has come here today to try and win some cash to keep the ranch afloat after this past summer's drought killed a third of the herd.  She sheepishly admits that part of her family's problems come from her poor contribution as her secret passion is creative writing. She's spent the past four years writing in her free time but it has failed to earn any publisher's attention.  She's going on to admit, embarrassed, that she never really felt as though she belonged here and that her writing allows her to escape into her dreams and fantasies.  But her inspiration has run dry in the past few stressful months and fears she may be losing her grasp of her imagination.  Maybe something about today might give her a new perspective in lift... or at least a bank account fattened with a nice chunk of cash.</pink>;
[LoseDesc]               <blue>With her transformation complete, you can hardly believe that this black-haired brawny centaur, muscle-clad both in  his warhorse stallion lower body and rippled, hypermasculine torso used to be a short, orange haired ranch girl.  His dented and beaten armor has evidently survived many battles with the wearer taking an equal beating but surviving them all to... and with all the scrapes and scars he brandishes, you're willing to bet it was Kara behind it every time.   But even though his voice is deep and rumbling, instilling nervousness in the hearts of the audience, you quickly learn that this centaur is no mere killing brute.  Before you stands Kentoleth Si'Trana, warrior king of a kingdom in a realm not so unlike our own.  Majestically he bows, thanking you and the audience for granting him hospitality on your world and the opportunity to resume his true form.  But he says that he must return home and steps into a shimmering blue ring of light that appears before him, vanishing with one great leap.  The last you see of this king is a whisp of his tail... then nothing.  At long last he is home.</blue>;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Kara scratches just above her butt, irritated.  She shortly discovers why as tufts of coarse, brown hairs slither out from the base of her spine like a tassel.  She twists around, trying to get look as the hairs stop growing after reaching about two inches in length.  She tugs at it a few times, tearing a few of the looser strands out in her $HANDS$, but most still remain.;

[tf]               Kara rubs above her $BUTT$ as the two inches of coarse brown hairs extend out to four, accompanied by several new tufts that give her tail some new density.  She yanks at it slightly as if trying to pull them out of her $PANTS$.  She emits a shocked yelp in her $VOICE$, discovering that the tail is attached pretty firmly to her body.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Kara's four inch tail slides out another couple inches to half a foot long, draping down her $BUTT$ and $PANTS$.  She strokes it meekly this time, aware that it's now a permanent part of her body.  She turns away, preparing for the next round.  But you notice that every now and then it twitches every so slightly...;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Kara's six-inch horse-like tail grows again, tumbling down to nine inches in length, draping down across the back of her $BUTT$.  But something else starts to happen as well--the brown hairs straighten out, lightening up a bit and taking on a light gleam as though someone had carefully run a brush through it earlier in the day.  Kara smiles and tries to run her $HANDS$ through the fine hairs, but with her lengthened horse body, she can't quite reach that far back anymore.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Kara's nine-inch fine brown tail begins to twitch, swaying side to side as it gains another three inches in length, a full foot long running along the back of her $BUTT$ and between her rear pair of $LEGS$.  In the blink of an eye, a fancy red ribbon appears near the bottom.  Kara giggles in her $VOICE$ and swishes it around in an almost... flirty manner.;
[status]               Kara has a foot-long tail made out of fine brown hairs that run down the back of her $BUTT$ and between her rear $LEGS$.  There is a fancy red ribbon wrapped around the tip that she seems to be having fun swirling around in a flirty manner.;

[tf]               The shade of fur on Kara's tail at the end of her $BUTT$ washes from light brown to a near black, the hairs losing their groomed neatness as it dangles down between her rear $LEGS$.  The red ribbon begins to glow a faint silver, morphing into a small, rusted metallic clasp that keeps the frayed hairs together somewhat.;
[status]               Kara has a foot-long tail made out of coarse black hairs that run down the back of her $BUTT$ and between her rear $LEGS$.  There is a rusty metallic clasp at the end that keeps some of the frayed hairs together.;

[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               Kara's tail begins to weave itself in a ponytail bound together by a small series of leather bands every couple inches.  The rusty metallic clasp remains at the very end, but a few spikes sprout out like some kind of spiked flail.  You doubt whether or not the spikes really have any combat use until you see Kara grunt in her $VOICE$, flicking her tail to one side to side the spiked clasp, sending it whipping through the air.  Although getting struck by it may not be deadly, it could certainly leave a bruise...;

[status]               Kara is wearing a pair of oversized, shin-high tan cowboy boots on her $FEET$, the worn leather stained by mud and manure.  They seem to have survived years of wear and tear... you wonder if they might have belonged to her father or grandfather before her.;

[tgShade]            shoes 50;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Kara's cowboy boots contract a bit to better fit her $FEET$, down from a large male's size to something more appropriate for her gender and height.  At the same time, the collar lowers descends to just above her ankles.  To add insult to injury, the boots also begin to grow a pair of heels in a womens' fashion.  She looks a bit distraught at the changes, even though technically they are a better fit.  At least the boots retain some of their tears and stains despite their new proportions.;
[status]               Kara is wearing a pair of ankle-high womens' fashion tan cowboy boots atop her $FEET$.  She looks at them with disgust as if she wished she had it back in its original, oversized shin-high masculine form.;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               As soon as Kara notices that her next transformation deals with her cowboy boots again, she tries to quickly tear them off of her $FEET$, muttering angrily as she fumbles at them with the fingers on her $HANDS$.  Even with them removed from her feet, however, they continue to shrink down into a pair of tan high heel slip-ons, fashionable and as good as new:  completely impractical for any form of ranch work.  Kara sighs and slips them back on.;
[status]               Kara is wearing a pair of small, tan womens's high-heel leather slip-ons over her $FEET$ that she doesn't seem very fond of, likely due to their complete impracticality of usage on the ranch.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Six small holes appear on the top of Kara's tan leather high-heeled slip-on shoes.  They expand until the only leather on the top of each shoe are two horizontal straps and one long one that originates between her big toe and next one over, merging into the rearmost strap.  They seem to be kind of cross between one-inch high heels and sandals that reveal most of her $FEET$.  Having recovered from her initial anguish at losing her heirloom cowboy boots in their original form, she slips her high-heeled sandals off and examines them curiously.;
[status]               Kara is wearing a pair of shoes that looks like a cross between a pair of one-inch heels and sandals.  They are still made out of a tan leather.;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Even while resting discarded by the base of Kara's podium, her two high-heeled sandals begin to change dramatically.  The soles morph into a disc shape while the leather straps grow taller, about eight inches high.  The tan color of the leather is washed away by a pink dye.  When everything is done, they have turned into girly pink horse boots, seemingly in some kind of high fashion from a world unlike your own... a fantasy universe from one of Kara's incomplete novels?  The only problem is that there are only two boots whilst Kara now has four feet... a problem that quickly solves itself as another pair pops in out of thin air and tumble down next to the original two.  Kara organizes them with a smile on her $FACE$, but she doesn't put them on just yet.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Kara mutters in her $VOICE$, bending her torso down as far as she can while lifting one of her front $FEET$ out in front of her.  You observe as her pink horse boots lose their pink dye, replaced by a faded brown leather smeared with grass stains.  You hear a slight metallic clink as she lowers it back down the studio floor--it seems that the soles are made out of steel or iron.;
[status]               Kara is wearing four faded leather boots on her four $FEET$.  The soles of each boot has a thin plate of metal for extra protection.;

[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               The metal soles at the base of Kara's leather boots begin to creep up, replacing more of the leather.  A slit forms on each side of each boot with buckles appearing on each side.  The tongue of the boot grows stiff and dense until it too is a thin sheet of steel protecting her shin from the ankle to the knee of each of her equine $LEGS$.  It's pretty apparent now that they are a form of armor, though you can only wonder how she is supposed to be able to put them on or remove them with her $HANDS$ unable to reach much farther down than her $WAIST$.;
[status]               Kara is wearing a set of steel and leather boots on each of her $FEET$.  It buckles together on each side and has a thick shin-protecting plate that runs from the ankle to the knee.  It is obvious that it is a form of armor.;

[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               Kara's armored horse boots creak as rust and red, blood-like stains appear on its metal and leather surface.  Worse, metal spikes and bristles ooze out around the ankles, solidifying into a nasty series of knife-like slivers, many with the points chipped off.  You aren't sure if the spikes are primarily decorative or if they actually serve a purpose in combat.  Either way, you certainly wouldn't want to find yourself on the receiving end of a kick from a centaur warrior wearing them!;

[status]               Kara's face is cute but tomboyish, her cheeks spotted with freckles and tan from hours working out in the sun.  She's not wearing any makeup... It seems as though she probably never has much occasion to put it on, if she even knows how to.;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Kara looks around at, trying to see what part of her is transforming.  You yourself don't notice at first as some of the freckles on her cheeks vanish, leaving only some of the darker spots behind.  In addition, some of the sunburnt parts of her cheeks and nose seem to have restored a bit more into a normal state.  She examiens herself in the mirror, tracing her cheeks with her $HANDS$ after you kindly point all this out to her.;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               The last remaining freckles on Kara's cheeks shrink into nothingness, leaving her skin soft and pure.  Her skin is all around a bit more pale and creamy as if she treated her skin with lotion and kept careful to wear sunscreen at all times.  Although she doesn't have any makeup on, her features seem a bit softer and rounder, more feminine in their contours, her skin a bit silkier to the touch.  She runs her $HANDS$ over her cheeks in surprise... she probably hasn't had skin this soft since she was a baby.;
[status]               Kara's face is cute but tomboyish, her skin milky white, free of any hint of a tan or freckles.  Although she doesn't have any makeup on, her features seem a bit softer and rounder, more feminine in their contours, her skin a bit silkier to the touch.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Kara's milky white cheeks redden a bit as blush and foundation fades in from nothing.  Her lips also brighten under a thin coating of lipstick that embellish a slightly plumper set of lips.  She's quite cute this way.  Kara peers into the mirror in wonder, smacking her lips together lightly, looking bewildered yet  enticed by her increasingly feminine reflection.;

[tf]               Kara blinks as her eyelashes lengthen, darkening under a magically appearing coat of mascara.  Pink eyeliner spread around her eyes next. drawing attention  to the fact that her irises themselves have changed from a plain brown to a muddy scarlet in color.  She's quite a sexy sight to behold, although perhaps the makeup has been applied a bit on the heavy side.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               The makeup painted on Kara's face, the eyeliner, blush, mascara, and lipstick seem to take on another coat.  There's a somewhat unnatural pink scheme to it all, especially as her lipstick brightens into a glistening red thick enough to leave those stereotypical kiss prints.  Most noticeably, however, her irises themselves take on a bright, glassy texture with  the shade of a rose.  Although the makeup is coated on visibly heavy, beyond what even a covergirl might wear, it's hard to pull your gaze away from its memorizing beauty.;
[status]               Kara's face is cute and feminine, her skin milky white painted heavily with blush, foundation, mascara, eyeliner, and lipstick that give her face a mesmerizing effect to it.  Her eyes themselves have taken on a bright, glassy color  the shade of a rose.;

[tf]               Kara scratches the back of her neck and the sides of her head with her $HANDS$.  It takes her a moment to notice that her ears are becoming taller and triangular, the skin fuzzy with a thin coating of tan hairs.  When they finish changing they appear quite horselike.  They twitch at the slightest touch, instinctively flicking as if swishing away flies.  Kara strokes them gently, humming contently in her $VOICE$ as ideas seem to flood in her head and stoke her creativity, distracting her from the game for a little while.;

[tf]               Kara seems to be sweating a little, a few beads of sweat trickling down her face.  Unfortunately it wrecks havoc on her heavily-applied makeup, causing some of it to run down in little trickles.  She tries to dab it away softly with her $HANDS$, but all she really succeeds in doing is smearing it around a bit worse.  She gives up, swearing a couple times in her $VOICE$, and does her best to pretend nothing is wrong.;

[tf]               Kara gasps, her face coated with a thin layer of sweat that is starting to run down in trickles, bringing along much of her blush, eyeliner, mascara, and lipstick with it.  She curses under her breath in her $VOICE$ before surrendering, wiping away as much of the makeup away with her $HANDS$ as she can, drying her fingers against the fur of her $BUTT$.  With the excess of makeup gone, Kara's face looks a lot more average, except for her rose-pink eyes and rotating triangular, horse ears.;

[tf]               Kara dabs at her sweaty face with her $HANDS$ as her facial structure itself begins to change, her skull itself morphing taller and more rectangular in its general shape with a broader, powerful jaw.  Her cheekbones are sharper and a few creases from stress or age, possibly both, become faint yet visible around her eyes and forehead.  All in all, her face appears somewhat androgynous except for her feminine rose-pink eyes.;

[tf]               Kara roars in her $FACE$, clutching her $HANDS$ over her face in agony.  When she draws them away and glances in a mirror, you notice that her face seems to have lost all traces of its femininity, her features sharp and defined, her skin tough and leathery.  Her chin and neck are dark with a five-o-clock shadow from what must be a quickly-growing beard.  Noticing you watching her, she glares at you, contorting her face into a fearsome sneer.  A moment later she smiles and chuckles in her $VOICE$, amused by your intimidation.  Despite all this, her eyes remain a feminine rose pink in color.;

[tf]               Kara bends around, trying to figure out what part of her body is currently transforming.  You, on the other hand, watch as several dark cuts and scars of various stages of healing form on her face, one of which looks as though it should have blinded her.  Kara initially gasps in her $VOICE$ when she finally notices the alterations in her reflection, but disgust turns into pride as if every scar were a trophy, a sign of her toughness and prowess as a warrior.  Lastly, her rose-pink color of her eye turns to a darker shade of scarlet... almost like blood.;

[tf]               With all of the recent transformations that have affected Kara's body, she has gone from being a young, human girl to a creature of mythology: a beautiful centauress, barely clothed with her mere $SHIRT$ covering her $BREASTS$ and a red ribbon tied around the end of her well-groomed, silky brown tail.  She trots around the studio, her $BREASTS$ jiggling with every impact of her $FEET$ to the ground.  She giggles in her $VOICE$, blowing kisses to you and at the audience, swishing her $CUSTOM1$ and stroking the short fur along her $BUTT$.  But despite all these changes, the game still isn't over... what's left of her to change?  You're curious to find out...;

Her voice does seem to have gained a bit of sexy poutiness to it, subtle yet much more likely to turn heads from the sounds of her voice alone.;

It grows wider at the hips, but instead of just growing plumper, her spine itself seems to expand a few extra vertebrae, a hump jutting several inches through the tear in her $PANTS$.

[tf]               Sweating, Kara runs the fingers of her $HANDS$ through her fading red, sweaty hair.  They come back with a slight pinkish tint from whatever kind of dye her hair had been infused with.  There's not much red color left to her hair now, leaving it mostly a dark, black-and-gray peppered color that shows a slight hint of both age and experience.  Meanwhile, what remains of her crown of dead, dried flowers crumbles away, leaving her hair ragged and unadorned.;

[tf]               Kara's peppered hair loses its last indication of being straightened or cared for as it grows a few inches longer , messy and tangled, slightly caked with twigs, mud, and what appears to even be dried... blood?  She tries to tuck it behind her ears, muttering angrily in her $VOICE$.  Luckily for her, some invisible force begins to braid her hail into a thick ponytail bound by several strips of leather in an almost militaristic, ceremonial manner.;

[tf]               Kara peers down as the lining of her faded pink t-shirt slides up a couple inches as if she were slipping it off around her head.  However, the waistline shrinks vertically until it reveals a band of flesh around her $WAIST$ that exposes her bellybutton.  Kara doesn't seem to mind this too much, but she looks disappointed as the image of the two horses and centaur on the front fade away considerably.;
[status]               Kara is wearing a sun-bleached, old pink t-shirt with a considerably faded image of two horses and a centaur on the front.  It has shrunk a little, exposing a couple inches of skin along her $WAIST$.;

[tf]               Kara bites her lower lip and gawks down at her torso as her pink t-shirt shrinks, not only exposing more of her $WAIST$ but the sleeves contract as well.  It's more like a tank top in shape, tight around her $BREASTS$.  Red colored dye  washes over the fabric, reversing the process the sunbleaching that has left it a faded pink.  On the downside, the image on the front is essentially gone, only a few off-color strokes to indicate that anything had ever been on the front.  Kara stares at it sadly... she must have some good memories associated with it in its original form.;
[status]               Kara is wearing a pale red shrunken, sleeveless t-shirt with only slight offcolor traces of the image on the front remaining.  It only reaches down to her sternum and is sleeveless, tight around her $BREASTS$.;

[tf]               More color returns to Kara's tank top until it is a bright, silky red that gleams in the studio lights.  Kara gasps in her $VOICE$ as a tearing sound accompanies a sparkling blue ball that circles around her tank top, slicing the fabric cleanly until it fizzles out of existence.  Kara is unharmed, but her tank top seems to have been converted into a long, bright red ribbon loosely wrapped around her $SHOULDERS$, $BREASTS$, and $WAIST$.  The fabric is very thin and somewhat transparent.;

[tf]               Kara tries to clutch the ends of the red ribbon that makes up what is left of her t-shirt in her $HANDS$ as each end fizzles away into the air with a slight pink mist.  She has little success in stopping it and can only watch as the thin, silky fabric shrinks down to just a single loop, hanging off one of her $SHOULDERS$ to expose her $BREASTS$.  Blushing slightly, she readjusts it so that it covers up her nipples, tying a knot on the side to get rid of some slack.;

[tf]               Kara gasps in her $VOICE$, surprised.  You watch, fascinated, as the red ribbon that was so precariously and pointless wrapped around her $BREASTS$ turns into a very thin strip of ornate metal with simple patterns around the perimeter.  It seems to support her tits a bit more than the ribbon, but you can still steal glances as parts of her areola as the band shifts when she breathes.;

[tf]               The metal band wrapped around Kara's $BREASTS$ begins to change shape, ripples of metal sliding to the edges of the garment and accumulating to form new layers. Two thin, silver discs grow out of the metal near each of Kara's nipples, forming a slight cup that acts somewhat like a bra, providing her breasts some support.  Small symbols--magical runes, it looks like--begin to glow a pale blue around the metallic garment.  Kara rubs at them with her $HANDS$.  Wherever she touches the runes glow brighter for a few moments... very mystical!;

[tf]               The ornately decorated, silver bra-like garment that Kara is wearing over her $BREASTS$  continues to grow in height and thickness.  Instead of merely covering her breasts, it extends several inches both higher and lower, covering up most of her ribcage.  The strap that runs around her back expands as well.  It's now clear that it functions as some kind of light armor, despite the fact that it still exposes almost all of her stomach and $WAIST$.  It seems somewhere between decorative and functional, but either way it is considerably less feminine than before.;

[tf]               Kara's $SHOULDERS$ sag a bit as the metal on her thin, silver breastplate ripples out, extending its protection to not just her $BREASTS$ but her entire torso, front and back.  It looks as though it could easily weigh thirty pounds.  She fidgets with it--it no longer seems to fit her quite as comfortably, designed for a heavier, more masculine figure than she currently has.  There's no doubt that it is more functional than decorative.  Several large dents and scratches verify that it has even been through a good bit of combat.;

[tf]               The heavy, thick silver breastplate protecting Kara's $BREASTS$ and $WAIST$ loses some of its shine with dozens of new dents, scratches, stains, and holes proving just how many battles it has been through.   The metal loses its silver cast in favor of a duller yet strong red-tinted steel.  Additionally, the breastplate grows even thicker, probably at least 50 pounds weighing heavily down upon Kara's $SHOULDERS$.  There's no doubt this is real armor for a real warrior!  Despite all the abuse it has taken, the runes (those that are still visible, anyway) retain their dull glow.;

    <h1>Updates, News, and Announcements</h1>
    <h4>We will be posting game updates, news, and a list of <a href="#contributorsTable">community contributors</a> here.</h4>

    <p>July 11</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Alpha Round 22 has ended!  The game will now enter chaos mode.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>July 6</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Added userlist on to chat rooms.  Right now this is done entirely on the client side, so refreshing the page will clear out the userlist.  Eventually the server will also keep track of online users and deliver this information on page load.</li>
        <li>When you cast a spell, your last attack is saved in localstorage. It will appear as the first link in your attack modal from then on out as a shortcut to casting that spell again. It will also appear in its usual place, so you will see that spell listed twice.</li>
        <li>Added a link to look at yourself under the "My Player" dropdown for animate players.</li>
        <li>Setting your nickname (for Tier 2 Patreon donators) to an empty form should now remove your nickname entirely, not throw a server error.</li>
        <li>There are two new forms on the Contributions page that allows you to set text that is shown for the item and the animate player using that item. This is only for Reusable Consumable type items. You will not yet see the text when using/being used in the game; so far this is limited to the Contribution pages.</li>
        <li>Inanimates and pets can now slip off of their owner after 24 hours of inactivity instead of 48 due to the double turn speed implemented a bit ago.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><span class="tldr">To all contributors who have recently submitted a contribution,</span> please make sure the proofreading copy has stats.  It seems that the server (and still is until fix goes live) was not adding any of the new stat values to proofreading copies when it created them.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>June 23</p>

    <ul>

        <li>Welcome to Transformania Time's new developer, <a href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/mezaron">Mezaron</a>!</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Alpha round 21 has ended!  The game will now enter chaos mode.</li>
        <li>Another new experimental feature can be activated on the Settings page which allows certain browers (primarily desktop; mobile support is pretty scattered) to push notifications, which means that a little window can pop up even if the browser is minimized informing you of recent event sent from the server.  In theory these notifications also allow mobile devices to vibrate when receiving a message.  Similar to audio sounds, this functionality is opt-in.  (Technically this feature has been live for a few days.)</li>
        <li>New graphic for the Enchanted Tree by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>!</li>
        <li><span class="tldr">Transformania Time is looking for more volunteer back end developers.</span>  Primarily we're looking for a back end dev with some working knowledge of C# and ASP.NET, preferable with some experience with Git, SQL, and javascript as well.  We would prefer candidates who have been with Transformania Time for at least the past three rounds and knows the general gameplay.  Please send me (Judoo) a message on the forums if you are interested.</li>

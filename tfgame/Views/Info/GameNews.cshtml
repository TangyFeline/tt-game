    <h1>Updates, News, and Announcements</h1>
    <h4>We will be posting game updates, news, and a list of <a href="#contributorsTable">community contributors</a> here.</h4>

    <p>August 11</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Alpha Round 24 is scheduled to begin tomorrow, August 12, at 10:00 PM UTC.</li>
        <li>The sneak mechanic has been changed.  Rather than a chance of leaving no movement log whatsoever, each movement log has a "concealment level" that is negated by having high Perception, which now gives a new substat anti-sneak.  Concealment level is set at your sneak level minus a random number between 0 and 75.</li>
        <li>Ending a turn on territory that your covenant controls will provide up to .25 extra AP per turn depending on its enchantment level.  The AP recovered goes directly into your reserve.  This effect  also stacks with the safeground AP recovery bonus.</li>
        <li>The enchantment level of your current location is now shown for animate players on the main Play page.</li>
        <li>Tweaked stats a little, making the effects from Discipline less powerful and increasing the power of Restoration.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>August 6</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Alpha Round 23 has ended!  Congratulations to Nerati Sua for earning the most dungeon points (tiebreaker was decided by higher level and then XP).  The game will now enter chaos mode until the next round begins.</li>
        <li>Items now have small icons that indicate their soul activity.  Soul activity is refreshed when an inanimate player or pet performs an action or sends a message and is used to indicate that the item is still "souled."  Bots and items/pets made from players who reroll do not have any icon as do items that have not performed an action in the past 72 hours.</li>
        <li>Jewdewfae will now also teach a few spells to players in addition to her XP bonus.</li>
        <li>Spellbooks teach more spells on average now, ranging from 4 new spells to 16 new spells based on its size.</li>
        <li>Psychopathic Spellslingers should obey the 3 cleanse/meditates rule now and should not attack at turn update with mana that they don't have.  Higher level psychos still get their extra attacks and can still counterattack for free.</li>
        <li>You can mark messages that you have receieved and read as unread, highlighting it in your inbox again.</li>
        <li>Added a couple modal helpers on the Contributions page when selecting locations or forms.</li>

    <p>July 11-22</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="tldr">Alpha Round 23 is scheduled to begin on Thursday, July 23 at 9:00pm UTC.</span></li>
        <li>Alpha Round 22 has ended!  The game will now enter chaos mode.</li>
        <li>Here are the plans for Alpha round 23:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Online userlist on chat now persists server side, so you should get a list of online users shortly after joining chat.  Users are also removed from the userlist when disconnected with an appropriate "has left the room" message.  A big thanks to Tempest for getting this all working!</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Mobile users should be able to double-tap a name in chat to print it out following the '@@' symbol, similar to the existing double-clicling on desktop computers.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Patreon donators now have an icon next to their names on the chat userlist.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Players can now begin as an inanimate item or pet!  Upon creating a character, players can choose a category and will randomly spawn as an item within it inside Lindella or Wuffie's inventory.  These players will start out locked in and cannot struggle free.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>There is a limit to how quickly players can reroll a new character.  This waiting period will increase the more times a player rerolls in a round.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Mind control spells now only require the victim to only be at 25% willpower or lower instead of at 0%.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETES:  </span>Rework / simplify / rename stats.  See this work in progress on test server <a href="http://transformania-time.com.plumeria.arvixe.com/Item/ShowStatsTable">HERE.</a></li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Private 1v1 duels, allowing players to engage in combat with one competitor without being interrupted by the outside world.  There will likely be a no-combat timer restriction on this, similar to donating Arpeyjis to your covenant or using Covenant Callback crystals.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>The tables on the Friends and Contribution / Effect Contribution effects now have easy sorting and filtering options.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>The Dungeon leaderboard is now active again.  As in previous rounds, this round, at its conclusion, will be renamed for the 1st place player on it.</li>

</ul>

        <li>New July 18:  A rough version of duels has now gone live.  You will see the option to duel other players in the attack modal.</li>
        <li>New July 19:  Duels support animate spells now.  The duel will end when all but one participant is in a form other than the one they began the duel in.  Failure to complete a duel within its time limit will curse all participants with a temporary debuff.</li>

    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>July 6</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Added userlist on to chat rooms.  Right now this is done entirely on the client side, so refreshing the page will clear out the userlist.  Eventually the server will also keep track of online users and deliver this information on page load.</li>
        <li>When you cast a spell, your last attack is saved in localstorage. It will appear as the first link in your attack modal from then on out as a shortcut to casting that spell again. It will also appear in its usual place, so you will see that spell listed twice.</li>
        <li>Added a link to look at yourself under the "My Player" dropdown for animate players.</li>
        <li>Setting your nickname (for Tier 2 Patreon donators) to an empty form should now remove your nickname entirely, not throw a server error.</li>
        <li>There are two new forms on the Contributions page that allows you to set text that is shown for the item and the animate player using that item. This is only for Reusable Consumable type items. You will not yet see the text when using/being used in the game; so far this is limited to the Contribution pages.</li>
        <li>Inanimates and pets can now slip off of their owner after 24 hours of inactivity instead of 48 due to the double turn speed implemented a bit ago.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>July 4</p>

    <ul>
        <li>New spell, From a Sunburnt Country, submitted by Troodon!  Additional credits go to Kizzyk for the inspiration, and Dorothea Mackellar for the spell name!

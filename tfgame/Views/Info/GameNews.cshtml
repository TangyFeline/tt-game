    <ul>
        <li>The chat rooms now have (optional and disabled by default) audio sounds that are triggered either when anyone posts in the room (All Sounds), only when someone deliberately addresses you using the @@ functionality (Some Sounds), or no sounds at all (No Sounds).  Your choice should be persisted on a per room basis, so you can have settings different between global and a private room.  Note that as with all audio elements, your browser or device needs to support the HTML5 Web Audio API for this to work.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>August 30</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You can now mix in the attacker or victim's name in spell transformation text.  To do this add $VICTIM_NAME$ to have it replaced with the victim's name or $ATTACKER_NAME$ to have it replaced with the attacker's name.  For example if you were to write "You hear $VICTIM_NAME$ moan" when your victim is named Bob Smith the text would be displayed as "You hear Bob Smith moan".  Note that this text change will not appear on the live server yet but will soon and new spells can be written using this mechanic or old ones updated to include it, if so desired. </li>

        <li>Alpha Round 24 is scheduled to begin tomorrow, August 12, at 10:00 PM UTC.</li>
        <li>The sneak mechanic has been changed.  Rather than a chance of leaving no movement log whatsoever, each movement log has a "concealment level" that is negated by having high Perception, which now gives a new substat anti-sneak.  Concealment level is set at your sneak level minus a random number between 0 and 75.</li>

        <li>The enchantment level of your current location is now shown for animate players on the main Play page.</li>
        <li>Tweaked stats a little, making the effects from Discipline less powerful and increasing the power of Restoration.</li>

        <li>Jewdewfae will now also teach a few spells to players in addition to her XP bonus.</li>
        <li>Spellbooks teach more spells on average now, ranging from 4 new spells to 16 new spells based on its size.</li>
        <li>Psychopathic Spellslingers should obey the 3 cleanse/meditates rule now and should not attack at turn update with mana that they don't have.  Higher level psychos still get their extra attacks and can still counterattack for free.</li>
        <li>You can mark messages that you have receieved and read as unread, highlighting it in your inbox again.</li>

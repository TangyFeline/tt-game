<p>Welcome, quest writer, to the quest editor!  Here is the basics on how to use this (admittedly confusing) quest editor to create your own quest.</p>


<h3>Quest Start</h3>

<p>A <b>Quest Start</b> holds some information about the quest and what it takes for a player to be eligible to begin it.  Quests must all begin in a specific location.  Players can only complete a quest one time per player but are allowed to fail it any number of times and restart.  Additionally, players are allowed to abandon a quest at any time unless they have reach an end state, in which case they must accept the consequences of failure or success.</p>

<p>Quest Starts begin with a certain Quest State.  </p>

<h3>Quest State</h3>

<p>A <b>Quest State</b> makes up the bulk of a quest.  A quest state is a certain stage of a quest that a player can be in that contains a text description of what is currently happening as well as a number of choices (children quests) that the player is eligible to attempt.  As such the way to think about questing is a Directed Graph in which each state is capable to leading to one or more other states.  You can read more about directed graphs <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">here</a> if you want.</p>

<p>Some terminology you may want to know for this:</p>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Parent Quest State</b>:  A parent quest state is the quest state that a player passesd through to get to the active one.  The very beginning quest state, the one that the player enters directly when starting a quest, does not have a parent quest state.</li>
        <li><b>Children Quest States</b>:  Children quests states are all of the possible quest states that are possible to get to from the active one.</li>
        <li><b>Jumping to Quest State</b>:  Some quest states allow navigation to non-child quest states via jumping.  This allows a quest state to lead back to any other state no matter where it is in relation to the directed graph.  These can be used to bring multiple branches back to a common quest state or even back to an earlier one that the player visited.</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h3>Quest State Requirement</h3>

<p>A <b>Quest State Requirement</b> is some condition that must hold true for a player to be eligible for an option that leads to a child quest state.  More than one quest state requirement can exist for a quest state; <b>ALL</b> conditions must be true for a player to enter it (a logical AND operator).  Quest State Requirements can be based off of a player's stats to allow unique options for certain builds or restrict others.</p>

<h3>Quest End</h3>

<p>A <b>Quest End</b> means that the current quest state indicates that the player has come to a place in the quest where they either pass or fail.  More than one quest end can be added to a quest state; when this is the case the player will recieve the reward from each quest end.</p>

<p>Each quest end can be marked as a pass or fail individually.  When there are multiple quest ends, the FIRST quest end's completion status will be used.</p>

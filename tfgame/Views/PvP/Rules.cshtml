    <h1>Rules</h1>

    <p>Below are some rules and a code of conduct you must follow in order to take part in Transformania Time.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>You are permitted to have two animate accounts.  One account can be in Protection/Superprotection mode and the othe must be in PvP.</b>  Do not use your Protection Mode account to help your PvP mode, which includes searching for items just to hand over, carrying surplus pets / items, or joining the same covenant simply for the sake of transferring Arpeyis to the PvP character.</li>
        <li>You may have as many characters who are inanimate or pets as you'd like; however the more you have the less amount of XP you'll gain per action per character.</li>
        <li>Scripting the game is not permitted.  This includes item auto-leveling scripts, page refreshes to see new messages / victims, crawling URLs, or anything else that puts an unecessary strain on the server and gives you an unfair advantage over other players.</li>
        <li>Be civil to other players and in global chat.  This means no hate speech, no racial slurs, etc.</li>
    </ul>

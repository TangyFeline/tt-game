    <p>January 9-13</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Alpha Round 14 has ended.  The game will be in chaos mode for a few days; my current goal is to get round 15 started early next week.</li>
        <li>New merchant, Wuffie the Soul Pet Vender, who acts like Lindella but buys and sells pets.  She has her own patrol route but generally stays in the same region longer.  Look for her in outdoors environments where she can grave her pets.  (Graphic is pending.)</li>
        <li>Items and pets that sit around abandoned for too long will go to Lindella's and Wuffie's inventories.  In the future items and pets that site around the their inventories too long may be deleted from the game.</li>
        <li>Here are the plans for Alpha round 15:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="good">MOSTLY FINISHED:  </span>Add some more higher level perks levelup perks, a new tier at level 8 at one at level 6.  Also add prerequisites for the higher level perks back in.</li>
            <li><span class="good">MOSTLY FINISHED:  </span>Mind control mechanics.  There will be a few different spells that take over certain parts of the victim's abilities, ie the ability to cleanse, meditate, move, attack, force them to strip and drop their inventory, and others.  Only the ability to command your victim to move will be active at the start of the round; I will work on releasing more mind control spells as the round progresses after letting people test them out on the test server.</li>
            <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Reintroduce and tweak PvP score.  The rules for gaining PvP score have been changed so that PvP score is given to the victor (but is still removed from the victim) if the level difference between the two players is less than or equal to 3.  This includes both the base Level*10 score gain as well as the PvP score stealing gain.  Additionally, a PvP mode player being inanimated by a friend in Protection will lose double PvP score.</li>
            <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Update Donna with new spells.  She will likely choose her spell based on the turn number.</li>
            <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Increase WP for all bosses except rat thieves.</li>
            <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Establish updated balancing rules for effect contributions.  The new acceptable balance score is set at -500.  Negative modifiers and caps are now disabled on the effect balance calculator tool.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>First and last character names are each limited to 12 characters long instead of 30 now.</li>
        <li>The base amount of WP recovered from cleansing has been dropped a little.</li>
        <li><span class="tldr">USING A PROTECTION MODE ALT TO CARRY YOUR EXTRA GEAR IS NOT PERMITTED AND IS AGAINST THE RULES.</span>  Don't do it--I don't want to disallow anyone from having alts because of this mechanic being openly abused.</li>
        <li>As a shout out for a friend, <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">Circine Milton / LexamTheGemFox</a> is in need of some money and needs to make some cash quickly.  Circine's offering to write spells or stories as comisisons.  Please help him out by reading more <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/journal/EMERGENCY-COMMISSIONS-OPEN-506733962">here</a>.</li>

    <p>January 5</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There was an issue with the second ingame poll in which all responses marked as "gay" in the sexual orientation question were being recorded down as "lesbian".  The problem should be fixed; however, if you had either one marked down or originally please double check to see if your correct response is still on the form.  Thanks!</li>
        <li>Various UI updates:  inanimate and animal players should be able to see offline players now after clicking the link.  Moved pet actions into a popup modal.  Location logs should not be reversed for anyone anymore.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>January 3</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Animals and items should now have their turn counter timer work again properly.</li>
        <li>Bugfix for not being able to doubleclick on names in chat when someone had an @@ in a post.</li>
        <li><span class="tldr">There is a new poll up that focuses on real-life information about yourself!</span>  As a reminder, all responses are optional and results are anonymous.</li>

        <li>As a notice to artists, please submit graphics at a 600x600 resolution and in a .jpg format.  This is to help reduce filesize somes.  Some of the recent graphics have already been converted to this new format.</li>

        <li><span class="tldr">No doubt you've noticed a major overhaul of the UI.</span>  Please leave all feedback about it on the <a href="http://luxianne.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=453">forums here</a>.  Please do not leave feedback on the chat as it is far easier for us to organize it in the forums and is overall far less stressful.</li>
        <li>You can now archive your spells.  Archived spells will NOT appear on your attack modal; this way you can keep that screen from being overwhelemed with spells you won't use or just have your favorite ones.  You can archive all your spells at once, restore all your spells at once, or archive/restore each one individually.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>December 28</p>

    <ul>
        <li>New RP functionality:  You can choose among some pre-selected tags that can be used to indicate to others what types of RP you enjoy and which you do not.  You can set these on your Player Bio page.  Click each tag to toggle them on or off and then save.</li>

        <li>New spell, Butt Kicking For Goodness!, submitted by Varn!  Graphic is by <a href="http://babblingfaces.deviantart.com/">Babblingfaces</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a Quixotic Ranger.</li>

        <li>Added a new type of covenant furniture, the Ultrasoft Feather Mattress.  This mattress helps players recover willpower and mana quickly overnight (great if your build saps either of these) but will also effectively prevent you from moving and fighting for eight hours, so careful when you decide to use it.</li>
        <li>New consumable item, the Autoselftransmogrification Deflector Device.  This item can be found from random searches or bought from Lindella and is used to transform oneself into any animate form that is a result of the spells they know.</li>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://lindella.net16.net/calc.php">Kevin Portalz has been busy working on an offsite tool</a>  that may help people plan out their item builds.  I have and will supply him with some raw JSON data that has complete information on item statistics as of the time of sending.  To be clear, neither me (Judoo) nor Mizuho have actively worked on this tool and are not the people to contact to request features, nor can we verify its accuracy.</li>
        <li>Something else that will help me for a feature I plan to work on tomorrow is a list of tags that players can toggle on or off on their player bios.  Please suggest tags for us to include on <a href="http://luxianne.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=446">this forum thread</a>.</li>
        <li>Mizuho started a Transformania Time group over on DA to gather all of TT's art from Deviant art into one place.  You can check it out <a href="http://transformaniatime.deviantart.com/">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>December 26</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Nothing today pertains directly to the game but here are a couple things you all may find interesting.  First is some fan art from last round by Katie Frills found <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ENRUyne.png">here</a>.  Secondly, Mizuho is running a general <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/Zu0JeZBLn9">transformation themed poll</a> ; any feedback you care to leave on that would be appreciated!</li>

    <p>December 22</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="tldr">Alpha Round 14 has started!</span>  As a note for all players who have custom starting forms, you will be given the chance to convert from the regular man/woman base form to your custom one on the Settings page by clicking the link that reads "Use my custom starting form (if available)".  If you are your old base form you'll be changed to it instantly.  Otherwise you'll need to use a Classic Me! Lotion first, or else struggle out of an inanimate/animal form, so it's best to do this as soon as you spawn in the world.</li>
        <li>Added a couple new locations to the Valentine Castle and rearranged its layout slightly.</li>
        <li>New spell, Undercurrent, written by myself.  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a mystical mermaid.</li>

    <p>December 20</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Due to recent events in the community, real life concerns, and the holidays I'm not sure how many new features will be part of Alpha Round 14.  Currently my plan is to have it kicked off by early Monday afternoon in Eastern US time.</li>
        <li><span class="tldr">For the upcoming round PvP mode will be partially disabled.</span>  Players will still be allowed to choose PvP or Protection mode, and while the PvP leaderboard will remain it will work similar to the XP one and only show players by level.  <b>Ranking first place on the PvP leaderboard will not grant the winner the honor of having Alpha Round 14 named in their honor.</b>  PvP mode will be reworked sometime in the future:  how to do so is being discussed on the forums and is an ongoing discussion.</li>
        <li>In light of the PvP changes, the only requirement now to change into and out of PvP is having not been in combat for 60 minutes.  You should not receive any debuff curses upon doing this anymore.</li>
        <li>If you are an author or artist who has contributed eight or more spells or graphics for spells (curses do not currently count) you are eligible for a custom base form.  Read more about it <a href="http://luxianne.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=400">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>December 17</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Congrats to Alexander Dantes for ending the round with the most PvP points.  The game is now in chaos mode while I prepare for next round.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>December 16</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Arists can now write up an extended biography allowing them to link to their ingame artwork themselves without having to wait for me to update them.  These extended biographies will be given to spell authors in a future date.  It is possible to see these extended artist biographies when looking at a player, however I will also gather these links up on other pages such as the News/Updates page where Contribution credits are listed.</li>

    </ul>

    <hr />


    <p>December 15</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Thanks for your patience during this relative lack of updates.  As the round nears a close, I anticipate getting the next round started on the 21st or 22nd.</li>
        <li>Lindella will now restock certain types of consumable items including spare willflower and spellweaver roots, teleportation scrolls, Classic Me! Lotions, and some of the effect-giving foods.  She will restock every two and a half hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>December 11</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Some updates to chat:
            <ul>
                <li>Added /me command.</li>
                <li>Added /dm [message] command, which uses the same style as the DM events but uses your own message for text.</li>
                <li>You can now set a custom chat color on the Settings page.</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>Donna's willpower will be much lower before she begins to cleanse now.</li>

This spell turns its victim into an incandescent Hero.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <p>December 10</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You can now see how many spells you know compared to how many currently exist in the game (at the time of writing the number is 223).  Weaken and curses should not be included in this count.</li>
        <li><span class="tldr">Players who wish to move into PvP mode with their character must do so by turn 1800.</span>  This is to help keep players from entering for the sole sake of being inanimated to boost friends' scores.</li>
        <li>New consumable type item, the Covenant Callback Crystal.  This crystal can be used to teleport a player back to their covenant safeground if they have not been in combat in the past half hour.</li>
        <li>New piece of covenant furniture, the Welcome Back Doormat which produced Covenant Callback Crystals mentioned above.</li>
        <li>New spell, Fabric of our Lives, submitted by Liahnna!  Additional credits go to Martiandawn for Proofreading!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a checkered cotton apron.</li>

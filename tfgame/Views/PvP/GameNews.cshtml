<h4>I will be posting game updates, news, and a list of <a href="#contributorsTable">community contributors</a> here.</h4>

<p><i>If the update date is given as today but there is no update listed here then the update was likely a bugfix that may not have warranted a post here.</i></p>

<p>October 13</p>

<ul>
    <li>Nicknames should now appear for players who are eligible to set them and have done so (Tier 2 donators).</li>
    <li>Jewdewfae will move a little more often and give on average a little more XP.  She will also leave a location early if she spends too many turns pass in one place, which should be between 8 and 9 hours.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>October 12</p>

<ul>
    <li>Added another Donation reward on Paypal for $7/mo pledges that allows players to freely set a nickname up to 20 characters.  This can be done on the Settings page.  It is possible to set it now but it will not appear to others in the game quite yet.  There is also the option to Verify your donation status which will look up in the database your donation records and should assign the appropriate tier instantly.  This is done automatically at character creation, but if you up a pledge or donate mid-round that link is how to force it to update, assuming I have added that information into the database.</li>
   
</ul>

<p>October 11</p>

<ul>
    <li>New spell, Sweet Dreams Are Made of This, submitted by <a href="http://martiandawn.deviantart.com/">Martiandawn</a>!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a pink latex dress.</li>
    <li>New spell, Tongue Twister, submitted by G0T0F66! Additional credits go to Thanks to Ani and Arrhae for proofreading and to BabblingFaces for creating the graphics.  Graphic is by BabblingFaces.  This spell transforms its victim into a rather unique tongue.</li>
    <li>New spell, Serpent Strike, submitted by Jess Ganes!  Additional credits go to Valentine Family, Elyn Kitsu, and Cara Doom. Graphic is by <a href="http://jbovinne.deviantart.com/">jbovinne</a>.  This spell transforms its victim into a half-woman half-snake creature. </li>
    <li>New spell, Soft 'n Sweet, submitted by Mahoney! Additional credits go to Rita Coker for the patronage to provide the image, Animate MeFreely for the proofreading, and Melodi, Cara, and Vivian for advice.  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell transforms its victim into an animate gummy woman.</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>October 10</p>

<ul>
    <li>Alpha Round 11 has started on the new server, <a href="http://transformaniatime.com/">http://transformaniatime.com</a>.  (Chances are you are on it it now.  If not, know that it will be used for primary round gameplay.  The old server will be kept around for testing purposes only.)</li>
    <li>New spell, Jawtastic!, submitted by Illia Malvusin!  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a dripping shark girl swimmer.</li>
    <li>New spell, Mothball, written by myself (Judoo).  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell turns its victim into an evasive fuzzy moth girl.</li>
    <li>New spell, Amazonian Allure, submitted by Varn!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim onto a muscle-bound Amazonian sporting something... manly.</li>
    <li>New spell, I Am Jack's Spell, submitted by Varn!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim onto a pillow-wielding sorority sister.</li>
    <li>New spell, Veni, Vidi, Venti!, submitted by <a href="http://gemai.deviantart.com/">Vivien Gemai</a>!  Additional credits go to Finley Gage for the roleplay that inspired it; dj-neko for the picture that inspired it, and Animate Mefreely for the proofreading.  Graphic is by <a href="http://dj-neko.deviantart.com/">dj-neko</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a sylph, an elemental spirit.</li>
    <li>Changed the yellow box at the top of the main play page to show number of players and how many of them are online.  In this case, online means the last time the player loaded up the Play page, not strictly spending AP, which is the other method that determines whether a player is attackable or not.</li>
    <li>The Friends page now shows the last activity of your friends instead of whether their character is Online (attackable) or not, using instead the new timestamp mentioned above.</li>
    <li>Players spawn with a full action point reserve now.</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>October 9</p>

<ul>
    <li>For those who missed the notifications or have not heard, the new round is scheduled to start tomorrow, Friday October 10 at 7:00pm Eastern Standard Time on the <a href="http://transformaniatime.com/">new, upgraded server</a>. The server has been upgraded to a plan that currently costs $120 monthly but should be sufficient for a good while and hopefully be adequate for future growth.  If you are working on any contributions, please continue to use this site.  When round 11 launches, I will copy the database over once again; from there on out please use the new server for all contribution submissions.</li>
    <li>A number of forms and items have been updated, both for spelling/grammar and their bonus values to reflect recent changes to the balance values.</li>
    <li>The levelup perks have been balanced using a score of close to 35.  This effects some levelup perks very drastically and others quite little; be sure to look at the new values before making a choice.</li>
    <li>A new Item leaderboard exists showing the top 100 items, their old human names, item type, and whether or not they are permanently sealed into the form.</li>
    <li>Location log messages will not be deleted before their 1 hour (up to 70 minutes, technically) expiration.  This is a bit of a test to see if the new server will be able to handle it and this may be reverted if it causes noticeable problems.</li>
    <li>I would also like to continue to thank Mizuho of <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne.com</a> for his ongoing efforts and accomplishments in some long-needed UI updates.  Anything that looks better than it used to, you can thank him for!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>October 5</p>

<ul>
    <li>With the other site up and running, I have spent some time looking into resource usage on the server as the new server seems to get its turns stuck.  The current plan is to try and upgrade the server a step higher--thank to the amount pledged on Patreon the cost is already covered.</li>
    <li>A little bit of good news:  Jewfewfae the Perverted Fairy is now up and live. Approach her in the correct form and play with her and she will reward you with some of her fairy magic that manifests itself as experience.  She will give out more experience to the first players who satisfy her requirements and the amount she gives will decrease each time down to a minimum of 15 XP.  Playing with her costs 5 AP.  After playing with a certain amount of people she will grow tired of her current fetish and relocate to a new location, desiring a new form for her partners to play with her in.  Players can only play with her once until she decides to relocate.</li>
      <li>Because of Jewfewfae requiring frequent form changes, the XP loss from being changed from one animate form to another has been removed (but not the mana loss.)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>October 4</p>

<ul>
    <li>Unfortunately the server migration has hit another snag, this time relating to migrating the database.  I am waiting for tech support to get back to me.  This will likely mean that the next round will either have to be delayed longer or start on the old server while the new one is still worked on.  I will provide more information later.</li>
    <li>Changed a couple balance values; expect some items to be rebalanced soon.</li>
    <li>Made some UI changes to the main play pages thanks to Mizuho of <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne.com</a>.  He will be assisting in development in the future so now is a good time to welcome him officially to the project!  I also made some changes to the Write message page so it tells you how many characters you have remaining.</li>
    <li>Transformania Time's <a href="http://www.patreon.com/TransformaniaTimeGame">Patreon</a> has reached $117 a month in pledges.  Once again thank you all to everyone who has pledged.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>October 3</p>

<ul>
    <li>The new site appears to be running--a few more fixes are required and then I will give out the link.  I believe the new round is on track to start sometime around Sunday afternoon but I will release a more concerete date at a later time.  As always thanks for your patience.</li>
    <li>The pledges from September's Patreon have been collected--thank you very much to everyone who pledged!  Here is what I was able to collect, copied from Patreon:  +$69.60 processed to your account from your patrons.  $78.00 Pledged / $4.50 CC Fees / $3.90 Patreon.  The server bill is set at $75 monthly, so the cost has been just about completely covered.  I will likely be implementing a couple new donation bonuses for higher donation tiers.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 29</p>

<ul>
    <li>Because the time between rounds may be a little lengthy again, I would like to share my current goals to accomplish before the start of next round.  They include:
    <ul>
        <li>Migrate to the new server.  As the Donate? page specifies, I am planning on upgrading the server to use Arvixe's ASP.Net VPS plan, which although may not be as powerful as initially hoped, it will be isolated from other sites using too much bandwidth and RAM.  This means that performance should be regularly as stable as the site usually is during non-peak hours where turn updates average some 50-80 seconds to complete.  I will spend a round or two evaluating whether the new plan is sufficient, whether the plan will need to be upgraded again, or if an entirely new hosting company will be necessary.</li>
        <li>A more minor rebalancing of item stats.  Currently Move Action Point Discount and extra transformation energy % removed when cleansing are under focus and will be made significantly more expensive.</li>
        <li>Some experimenting on new ways to handle turn updates.  I have some ideas on how to make them run faster, or at least change it so that the bulky portion of the update (calculating each player's WP and Mana regeneration) is done less obtrusively.</li>
        <li>Item leaderboard.  Hopefully for real this time.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 28</p>

<ul>
    <li>Alpha Round 10 has ended with Cole Kurtz in first place on the PvP leaderboard.  The game will be inbetween rounds for a while as a new, faster hosting service is set up.</li>
</ul>

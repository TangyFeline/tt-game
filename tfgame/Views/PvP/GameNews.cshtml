<h4>I will be posting game updates, news, and a list of <a href="#contributorsTable">community contributors</a> here.</h4>

<p><i>If the update date is given as today but there is no update listed here then the update was likely a bugfix that may not have warranted a post here.</i></p>

<p>November 28</p>

<ul>
    <li>The new round, Alpha Round 13, is scheduled to begin tomorrow at 19:00 UTC.  Look at the update a couple posts down for information on what updates to expect.  Notably, I have added a proposed idea that gives PvP players a small trickle of PvP score each update they spend online.  Please read about the discussion revolving around PvP <a href="http://luxianne.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=342">here</a> and provide feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p>November 24</p>

<ul>
    <li>Chaos mode will continue a few days more.  My current aim is to begin the bext round on Friday or early on Saturday as many will be gone for the holidays.  Now that I am back in town I will resume working on updates for next round; as always you can track the progress in the post below this one.</li>
    <li>I'd also like to point out that Luxianne and Mizuho are currently running a Christmas event.  Purchase one of fourteen Christmas presents; each contains a 5-step transformation feature an OC or an image of yourself.  You can read more about it here:  <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/art/Luxa-s-X-mas-Special-2014-496066858">Luxa's X-mas Special 2014.</a>.  <i>Please note that if you are a contributor and would like for me to send out an update like this for your own promotional events, pleases send me a message in the forums.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>November 18 - November 28</p>

<ul>
    <li>Alpha round 12 has ended with Soul Blossom at the top of the leaderboard.  Congratulations!  In a few hours I will allow the latest boss to be resummoned for those who did not get a chance to see the event in the round; later on I'll put the game into chaos mode.  Due to the holidays and a good deal of coding I need to do before next round, the next round will likely not start until the 25th or later.  In the meantime I will post planned round changes here so you can track the progress of the game here.</li>
    <li>Here are the plans for Alpha round 13:</li>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Refactor the perks/effects code.  This also means that I will *finally* be able to start adding in more of the player contributed effects.</li>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Complete publish and proofreading tools for effect contributions.</li>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Limit covenants to 25 animate members at a time.  When this limit is reached, no new players can join and inanimate/animal players will not be able to return to animate until there is room (but they will still be able to struggle to get the % chance of success higher.)</li>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Covenant Captains:  Allow the leader of a covenant to give 'captain' status to a covenant member, allowing them to handle covenant treasury affairs and purchase furniture.  I am not decided whether or not they will also be allowed to accept new members.</li>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Allow players who reroll a new character after being inanimated / animalified to retain their spells to their new character.  Also fixed the bug where rerolling players are allowed to choose perks equal to one less than their new level.</li>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Implement curses available to players who have a certain item or pet equipped.  (None of these effects are currently released yet though--I'll release a few before next round starts for the sake of testing them, then plan on doing more when the round has kicked off).</li>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Readjust the minimum turn counts in which the various bosses can spawn to be more spaced out throughout the round.</li>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Lower round turn count to 2,500 turns instead of 3000.</li>
        <li><span class="bad">IN PROGRESS:  </span>Ingame polling feature to collect quick and easy data on things like how many players liked the new 3000 turn length, prefer the old 2000 one, or would like try out something inbetween.  Low priority.</li>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Provide all animate PvP players a small amount of PvP score each turn they are online.</li>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Sending a friend request will now notify players in their activity logs.  As an anti-spam measure, if the targeted friend already has a message about it in their activity log, even dismissed, they will not receive another one.</li>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Items and pets can now slip away from their owner if their owner has been inactive for more than 48 hours.</li>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Instead of strictly requiring being offline, players can now enter or leave Protection mode after an hour of having not been in combat and not totally offline.  Similarly, players can donate to their covenant treasury if they have not been in combat for 30 minutes instead of having performed no actions in the past 30 minutes.</li>
        <li><span class="good">FINISHED:  </span>Items and pets should now see notifications on the main Play page the same as animate players do.</li>
        <li><span class="bad">UNSTARTED:  </span>Low level fox (or another animal) theif boss.  Steals from the rich and... keeps it.</li>
     </ul>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>November 13</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug where effects were not affecting maximum willpower and mana bonus.  I believe this should have a fairly minimal effect on human players but it will give the psychopathic spellslingers significantly more willpower.</li>
    <li>Items and pets now receieve 5xp per action instead of 3.5xp.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>November 11</p>

<ul>
    <li>Some change to the psychopathic spellslingers:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Higher level psychopaths can now spawn at level 7 (Loathful) and level 9 (Soulless).  Certain turn requirements must pass before the higher tiers can be spawned.</li>
        <li>Psychopaths have stronger and more dangerous perks at the higher levels.  Additionally, the level 7 and 9 psychopaths can now counterattack one or twice respectively in addition to their regular 3 attacks as the beginning of a turn.</li>
        <li>Psychopaths will not pick out targets that is of a lower level than them anymore (unless first provoked).  Psychopaths will not choose out a new target if the victim has less than 75% of their willpower (meant to stop bots from swooping in and stealing other players' takedowns.)  Psychopaths will still not choose Protection mode players when initiating a new attack.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>November 9</p>

<ul>
    <li>Players can gain some extra action point refill when ending the turn at their covenant safeground equal to .25 points * covenant level, which should offer some more encouragement to upgrade to higher levels.  Be warned that covenant size restrictions will almost certainly be added in for next round which will limit the number of (animate) players in a covenant at a time.  <i>There is currently a bug that throws a runtime error after successfully upgrading a covenant; this has been noted.  The upgrade itself should go through fine.  This will be fixed in the next update.</i></li>
    <li>The View all Covenants page now shows covenant level as well as its safeground if it has established one.</li>
    <li>Made some changes to the Contribution page.  This shouldn't effect anything but please let me know if it has introduced any new bugs.</li>
    <li>New spell, Tale as Old as Time, submitted by Liahnna! Additional credits go to <a href="http://martiandawn.deviantart.com/">Martiandawn</a>, Kaitlyn Halliwell and Annie for bouncing ideas off them, and <a href="http://martiandawn.deviantart.com/">Martiandawn</a> for proofreading.  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell transforms its victim into the Belle of the Ball, quite the beauty queen.</li>
    <li>New spell, Sweet Surrender, submitted by <a href="http://martiandawn.deviantart.com/">Martiandawn</a> with their own graphic.  This spell transforms its victim into a Collared Lap Girl, a pet type spell.</li>
    <li>New spell, Welcome to the Dollhouse, submitted by <a href="http://martiandawn.deviantart.com/">Martiandawn</a>!  Graphic is by Babblingfaces.  This spell transforms its victim into a woman either human or doll--or perhaps both.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>November 6</p>

<ul>
    <li>The new boss is now summonable over in the Treasure Chest stage.  Her name is Lady Lovebringer, PHD and her intent is bring on the Bimbocalypse, a highly contagious virus that transforms its victims into her own personal bimbo army.  Keep an eye out for vials of the antivirus that will be airdropped around the town every other turn as they will be important in defeating her and her plague.  A very big thanks to Babblingfaces for doing all of the graphics for this boss event!</li>
    <li>There is now a link on the Contribute page and that allows you to message the author of a contribution (this is for the sake of proofreaders and artists being able to get in touch with the authors more easily.)  This link also exists when editing the artist assignment on the "Spells Approved but Awaiting Implementation" page.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>November 2</p>

<ul>
    <li>My apologies for a slow update cycle; work on the bimbo boss is underway and should be ready to be go before the end of the round.</li>
    <li>New spell, Ground Under Foot, submitted by Duhad! Additional credits go to JBovinne.  Graphic is by <a href="http://jbovinne.deviantart.com/">jbovinne</a>.  The spell turns a defeated mage into a pair of heeled boots that, in turn, stomp on more mages.</li>
    <li>New spell, Princess Topper, submitted by Duhad! Additional credits go to JBovinne.  Graphic is by <a href="http://jbovinne.deviantart.com/">jbovinne</a>.  This spell transforms its victim into a pretty amathyst tiara.</li>
    <li>New spell, Icarus' Dream, submitted by Mahoney!  Additional credits go to Taenil Auxifur for the spell name.  Graphic is by Babblingfaces.  This spell transforms its victim into a winged harpy straight from Greek mythology.</li>
</ul>

<hr />



<p>September 28</p>

<ul>
    <li>Alpha Round 10 has ended with Cole Kurtz in first place on the PvP leaderboard.  The game will be inbetween rounds for a while as a new, faster hosting service is set up.</li>
</ul>

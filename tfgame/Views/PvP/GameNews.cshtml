<h4>I will be posting game updates, news, and a list of <a href="#contributorsTable">community contributors</a> here.</h4>

<p><i>If the update date is given as today but there is no update listed here then the update was likely a bugfix that may not have warranted a post here.</i></p>

<p>September 29</p>

<ul>
    <li>Because the time between rounds may be a little lengthy again, I would like to share my current goals to accomplish before the start of next round.  They include:
    <ul>
        <li>Migrate to the new server.  As the Donate? page specifies, I am planning on upgrading the server to use Arvixe's ASP.Net VPS plan, which although may not be as powerful as initially hoped, it will be isolated from other sites using too much bandwidth and RAM.  This means that performance should be regularly as stable as the site usually is during non-peak hours where turn updates average some 50-80 seconds to complete.  I will spend a round or two evaluating whether the new plan is sufficient, whether the plan will need to be upgraded again, or if an entirely new hosting company will be necessary.</li>
        <li>A more minor rebalancing of item stats.  Currently Move Action Point Discount and extra transformation energy % removed when cleansing are under focus and will be made significantly more expensive.</li>
        <li>Some experimenting on new ways to handle turn updates.  I have some ideas on how to make them run faster, or at least change it so that the bulky portion of the update (calculating each player's WP and Mana regeneration) is done less obtrusively.</li>
        <li>Item leaderboard.  Hopefully for real this time.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 28</p>

<ul>
    <li>Alpha Round 10 has ended with Cole Kurtz in first place on the PvP leaderboard.  The game will be inbetween rounds for a while as a new, faster hosting service is set up.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 27</p>

<ul>
    <li>Donna has been despawned and the new boss, Valentine is now active.  Valentine is a vampire lord who can be randomly summoned after turn 750 by searching in the castle armory.  Upon defeat he will give his defeater a special, unique item.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 25</p>

<ul>
    <li>In light of the server's recent poor performance I am aiming to try and upgrade the server after this round has ended.  <a href="http://www.patreon.com/TransformaniaTimeGame">I have set up a Patreon page</a> for anyone who would care to throw some money to cover the upgrade.  There's a new link on the top of the page that will tell you more about it.  Thanks to <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne and Mizuho</a> for the artwork on the Patreon's front page and assistance in getting everything set up.</li>
    <li>PvP players (which is everyone who does not have Protection turned on) now has the old PvP icon back next to them to more quickly distinguish what's going on.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 24</p>

<ul>
    <li>Donna has been changed so that she is a much higher level, 20 instead of 10.  However, her willpower and attack strength has been reduced to make it easier to take her on.</li>
    <li>New spell, Man's Best Friend, submitted by Soren Reus!  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell transforms its victim into a loyal husky.</li>
    <li>New spell, C-c-cocks?!, submitted by Madokami!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell transforms its victim into a dick-loving slut.</li>
    <li>Some actions are now disabled while the server is in its player portion of the update process, including moving, searching, cleansing, meditating, and using items.  With the recent population growth turn updates are taking a long time and the chance of numbers being forgotten (such as cleansing during an update only to have your willpower reset shortly later) have gone up; this is to try and keep the game from doing this as often.  I am researching some methods to improve update speed but these will likely not come to fruition for some time yet.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 19</p>

<ul>
    <li>New findable consumable item:  Concealment Cookies.  Eating one of these treats will raise the consumer's sneak for a short while.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem that makes sneak occur as it should and stumbling happen far less.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 18</p>

<ul>
    <li>Three new regions:  The Henryson Medical Clinic to the south and the Scarlet Forest and Silent Caverns to the northeast.</li>
    <li>New spell, Humanus Duplus, submitted by <a href="http://lemrith.net">Yassay</a>!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a Girl-Taur, a human girl with a second, back set of legs.</li>
    <li>New spell, Woolie Bully, submitted by Lazy Loki!  Additional credits go to Elynsynos. Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a shy, wooly sheep girl.</li>
    <li>New spell, Hold On to Your Nuts, written by myself. Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell transforms its victim into a hyper squirrel maid.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 16</p>

<ul>
    <li>Picking up, using, and dropping items will not totally reset your offline counter anymore but will add 15 minutes onto it, up to the usual maximum of 60 minutes.  This applies to both PvP and Protection mode players.</li>
    <li>Using consumables and reusable consumables will leave a message in the location log now specifying what was used.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 15</p>

<ul>
    <li>Players in protection mode can vuluntarily drop their willpower to half or zero in order to make transformations cast against them go faster.  Players in protection can see this option on the Settings page.</li>
    <li>The top 100 PvP players are once again shown on the PvP leaderboard.  This is to help players see who is online and at what levels in order to select their targets more efficiently.</li>
    <li>The contributions a player has submitted that is live in the game will now be displayed on their Bio page if they have one written.  Once again, if you are missing some contributions that you wrote up but does not appear on your Contribution page, please send me a PM in the <a href="http://luxianne.com/forum/index.php">forums</a> with your <b>account name</b> so I can properly link it back to you.  (Please note that only full contributions are currently listed, not blessing/curse contributions yet.)</li>
    <li>Cleansing should never restore a negative amount of willpower, nor should meditateing ever restore a negative amount of mana.  Additionally, cleansing with too large of a negative TF energy removal will do nothing instead of adding more tf energy.</li>
    <li><strike>For PvP Players Only:  Using, picking up, and dropping items will now reset your offline counter.  Equipping or unequipping items will not.  This is meant to stop players from being safe if they consume a bunch of petals while in the process of going offline.  Protection mode players will not have their offline counters reset upon performing these action.</strike></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 14</p>

<ul>
    <li>Alpha Round 10 has started!  The world has been reset and everyone is starting off on a clean slate.  A few new spells will be coming along shortly.  There is still a small handful of forms and pets that need to be updated (generally improved) but these are in the small minority.</li>
    <li>New spell, High Life, submitted by Christopher! Additional credits go to Liahnna, Absolutely Not, Tessa and a few others for discussion. Meddle for the image. Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a lovely evening dress.</li>
    <li>New spell, Where Angels Fear to Tread, submitted by <a href="http://martiandawn.deviantart.com/">Martiandawn</a>!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a pair of Victorian Lolita boots.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 12</p>

<ul>
    <li>Players with a PvP score of 0 won't show up on the PvP leaderboard anymore.</li>
    <li>Halved the chance of stumbling for players with a large negative evasion.  Right now a player with -100 evasion will stumble every other movement on average.</li>
    <li>Being in the same covenant should not stop two players from earning XP from casting spells on each other anymore.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 11</p>

<ul>
    <li>Thank you all for your patience.  I'm hoping on starting the next round off within the next 3 days; I'll provide at least 24 hours of notice before the planned start time so check back every now and then.</li>
    <li>The new willpower damage and TF Energy formula has been implemented.</li>
    <li>Added the new PvP score mechanism.  When a PvP player takes down another PvP player, in addition to the XP lump sum they will receive a PvP score equal to the victim's level (as long as the victim is no more than 3 levels below the attacker) and steals a quarter of the victim's PvP score (all the time, level difference does not matter).</li>
    <li>The XP lump sum from completing inanimate/animal transformations is now reserved for PvP mode players.  This may change as it's hard to gain XP at the higher levels, however I feel as though PvP players will not be able to level up as quickly as their Protection counterparts.</li>
    <li>The leaderboard now goes to a PvP version where rank is earned by PvP score instead of Levels/XP.  There's still a link to the old leaderboard that is ranked in the old way.  The way to "win" a round now means to have the highest PvP score.  There is a new icon on this board that shows which players are online at a given moment.  I am planning on adding an item leaderboard as well, though this may be shortly after round 10 begins.</li>
    <li>Players must be offline in order to enter or leave protection mode if they are animate.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Updates between alpha rounds 9 and 10 (last update September 3)</p>

<ul>
    <li>This update will be used to list currently implemented and planned updates for next round as well as their implementation status.</li>
    <li><span class="good">IMPLEMENTED:</span>  All player levels can now enter or leave protection mode.  The cooldown has been changed from a strict 2-hour delay to a much longer 9 turn * player level cooldown that only goes down on game updates when the player is online at rollover.</li>
    <li><span class="good">IMPLEMENTED:</span>  Having negative evasion means that players is clumbsy and have a chance of tripping and falling while trying to move, wasting 1 action point.  This is proportional to how large of a negative evasion value that player has.  The player will still move now even if they stumble.></li>
    <li><span class="bad">CANCELLED / POSTPONED:</span>  A penalty for having a large negative accuracy / evasion negation statistic.</li>
    <li><span class="good">IMPLEMENTED:</span>  Change to extra damage / extra resistance formula.</li>
    <li><span class="good">PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED:</span> Split the leaderboard into three for highest XP/level, one for highest PvP score (this will be discussed a little below), and one for items/pets.  The winner of the PvP board will be the winner of the round, which will of course exclude all Protection players.</li>
    <li><span class="good">IMPLEMENTED:</span>  New PvP score that relies on opponents inanimated / animaled instead of XP/Levels.  Look for a forum thread detailed proposed changes later.</li>
    <li><span class="good">MOSTLY IMPLEMENTED:</span>  Changes to various buff costs on the balance calculator.  Please leave your thoughts on the forum thread discussing this <a href="http://luxianne.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=234">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>September 1</p>

<ul>
    <li>Alpha round 9 has ended with Hanna Patterson in first.  Congrats!  The game will enter chaos mode later tonight.  My main goal inbetween rounds is to work on some balancing.  Take a look at the page  <a href="http://transformania-time.com.plumeria.arvixe.com/PvPAdmin/ServerBalance_Forms">here</a> to see what forms and items are most in need of some balancing revisions; my focus will be primarily updating the strongest and weakest forms, items, and pets.  I suspect this will take a few days so I don't want to give a starting date and time for round 10 yet.  I also encourage everyone to leave their thoughts on a proposed formula change for how extra damage and resistance is handled; please read more and leave your thoughts on it <a href="http://luxianne.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=226">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 31</p>

<ul>
    <li>New spell, Pyromantic Playlist, submitted by Jackie/Helen Castle! Additional credits go to Ani and Ruby.  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a fiery party girl!</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 29</p>

<ul>
    <li>Bugfix:  The game shouldn't stop a level 3 player from advancing to 4 by discarding XP until the player leaves protection mode anymore.  This has been bumped up a level.</li>
    <li>Almost all of the contributions should have a proofreading copy now.  There are still a handful of spells that don't have them just yet:  Glossy Marble Statuette, Sleek, Fiery Skateboard, Loyal Hip-Hugging Blue Jeans, Fashionable Pink Dress, Black Latex Pants, Impossibly Big-Breasted Lady, Self-Refilling Silver Whiskey Flask, Leopard Patterned Bra, Bundle of Red Balloons, Silk Tight Tube Top, Black 3-Inch Stillettos, Vibrating Purple Latex Thong, Flirty Olive-Skinned Barmaid, Pirate Wench, Black Latex Bra, Enchanted Tree, Drow Priestess, Cursed Doll, White Tiger, Magic Slut Ball, Randy Satyr, Adorable Donkey Foal, Vampire Lord, Unimaginably Huge-Breasted Woman, Shiny Robot Girl, and Milk Cow.  I need to enter these all in by hand.  I'm also planning on having player bios show all of the spells they have contributed to the game, but a number of spells have had their account numbers a bit botched <b>so if you have a spell that is live in the game that doesn't show up on your Contribution page</b>, please make a post in the <a href="http://luxianne.com/forum/index.php">forums</a> with your <b>account name</b> so I can properly link it back to you. </li>
    <li>The Contribution page now links to a balance calculator where you save change the stats and save directly from that page instead of copying and pasting to the relevant fields on the main form.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 28</p>

<ul>
    <li>There is a 45 second delay after your last attack before you are allowed to move.</li>
    <li>Protection mode has been raised one more level from 3 to 4.  This will enable protection mode players to fight the bosses.</li>
    <li>Psychopaths should not cast curses anymore.  Also they will temporarily only cast inanimate and animal type spells for the time being; this will probably be changed again in the future.  These changes will only affect new psychopaths that spawn.</li>
    <li>Throwing splash orbs now counts as an attack and will use up one of the three available attacks per round.</li>
    <li>The Pink Pulsar should be fixed now and provide willpower and mana again.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 26</p>

<ul>
    <li>Pyschopaths will now earn XP significantly more slowly.  However, stronger variants will spawn on certain turn numbers now, Fierce and Wrathful psychopaths that will spawn at levels 3 and 6.  UPDATE:  Increased bot XP gain but it's still less than a normal.</li>
    <li>Psychopaths will not pick out <i>new</i> targets who are more than two levels weaker than them.  However, attacking them at any level still has a chance of drawing their aggro.</li>
    <li>New spell, Brünnhilde's Aria, submitted by Aethar!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a massively obese woman because the show's not over until she sings, or so a saying goes.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 25</p>

<ul>
    <li>Both willpower and TF energy resistance should be capped at 50% now.  (For a short bit it was at 75% instead.)  Expect some changes to the formula in the future.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 24</p>

<ul>
    <li>New spell, Dancing with the Stars, submitted by Kaitlyn Halliwell! Additional credits go to Annie Livingston and Elyn Usagi.

</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 23</p>

<ul>
    <li>New spell, Out to Pasture, submitted by Swogrider! Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a docile cowgirl, a pet type.</li>
    <li>Made some fixes to levelup perks.  I reset everyone's perks but you can reclaim them equal to your level minus one.</li>

    <li>New spell, Otterly Adorable, submitted by Soren Reus! . Graphic is by <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/user/kyetwolf/">Kyethusky</a>.  This spell turns its victim into an adorable otter boy.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 22</p>

<ul>
    <li>Added some DM (Dungeon Master) commands that can be used in chat rooms.  Given an action and a theme they return a random message meant to help with RP sessions.  There's also a system for contributing these DM encounters that can be found by clicking the "Go to DM Encounter contributions" link at the top of the Submit New Content page.  These will need to be approved before they can be randomly rolled.</li>
    <li>Each chat room now has its messages saved to the database and history up to 3 days old (starting as of today) can be read.  Also, "<" and ">" characters entered into the chat will now be replaced with "[" and "]", respectively.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 18</p>

<ul>
    <li>Round 9 has officially started!  My apologies for the long day.</li>
    <li>The second-tier of levelup perks are now worth as much as the first level of them.  They will continue to stack.</li>
    <li>Contibutors and proofreaders, note the new changes on the Contribution page.  Instead of posting code in from the calculator it should now be added directly into the relevant fields (but please do continue to use the calculator to get close to the desired balance amount.)</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 17</p>

<ul>
    <li>Thank you all for your patience I as refactored code.  Round 9 is scheduled to launch tomorrow at 5pm EST (Eastern Standard Time). Included with the start of the round will be a number of new spells (at least 7). Thanks for your patience!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 13</p>

<ul>
    <li>Round 8 has officially ended!  Congrats to Alicia Arriola for being on top place of the leaderboard.  You can see the top 100 most powerful players on the Round 8 completed leaderboard found <a href="http://transformania-time.com.plumeria.arvixe.com/PvP/OldLeadboards?round=8">here</a> this game will now enter chaos mode for a while and Donna will be making another appearance soon for the sake of testing.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 10</p>

<ul>
    <li>The psychopaths are now back on their feet and should move to chase their targets and seek new ones again.</li>
    <li>Some more game fan art!  Go check out <a href="http://spacedande.deviantart.com/art/Doll-Kaitlyn-474600430">Kaitlyn Halliwell as an Ice Queen sex doll</a>, a comission created by <a href="http://spacedande.deviantart.com/">Dandelion</a>. </li>
    <li>The game's first boss, Aunt Donna Milton, is now live.  She and future bosses can be summoned after a given turn number once per round when a player randomly searches in a specific location.  Donna Milton is a character from <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">Lexam the Gem Fox's stories</a> so if you want to learn more about her, go give his mythos a read!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 9</p>

<ul>
    <li>Slight change to how protection mode works:  a player's friends can cast any spell, including inanimate and animal, against them as long as both are in protection mode.</li>
    <li>Players who start as a new character should now have the item or animal they once were set to permanent.</li>
    <li>After 23 hours of being offline, players will no longer be updated in the turn update in order to save some time (this is more than enough time to have both action points and the action point reserve fully fille).  Essentially this should only mean that your willpower and mana won't continue to rise or fall based on your form, items, and effects after 23 hours of being offline.</li>
    <li>Inanimate players are now able to see the location log of the activity around them.  If you are currently being worn, however, you will not be able to see the messages that mention who entered and left the location.</li>
    <li>I have updated the login and register page to require users to acknowledge that they have read and understand some legal disclaimers revolving around the sometimes adult nature of this game.</li>
    <li>Inanimate players can now also see the players in the same location as their owner.</li>
    <li>The My Spells page now lists how many spells a player knows.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 5</p>

<ul>
    <li>New spell, Sunny Happiness, submitted by <a href="http://thegreatdaeo.deviantart.com/">Great Daeo</a>!  Additional credits go to Skyward for the awesome transformation sequence and some proofreading..  Graphic is self-made.  This spell turns its victim into a beach babe.</li>
    <li>New spell, Doggy Owner, submitted by Arnisd!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a pink dog collar.</li>
    <li>New spell, Writ of Sealing, submitted by Taenil Auxifur!  Graphic is by <a href="http://spacedande.deviantart.com/">Dandelion</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a scrap of a scroll that turns into a tattoo when pressed against its owner's skin.</li>
    <li>New spell, Slippery Swimsuit, submitted by Illia Malvusin!  Additional credits go to Animate Mefreely and Arrhae for proofreading and editing, as well as Cara Doom for the spell name.  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a one-piece latex swimsuit--something for these new beach babes to wear, perhaps?</li>
    <li>Long-time player and friend Circine Milton has come across tough times and would like the community to know that he is willing to write spells for players as $10 commissions. You can contact him and find out more <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">at his Deviant Art page</a> where you can also read his stories and learn more about the happenings around the Milton Ranch.</li>

    <li>New spell, Identify, submitted by Medli!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a magnifying class that helps players focus on their targets, and may down the line decrease the cost of searching slightly in the future.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>August 2</p>

<ul>
    <li>Tweaked searching a bit:  it is now a little more likely to find an item instead of Arpeyjis than before.  Players should also now always receive at least some XP when they fail to find a spell, item, or gain a location effect.  Receiving the "you get the feeling there are no more spells around here" message is equivalent in the game logic of finding a spell (it provides you with the information to move on).</li>
    <li>Psychopaths will no longer select players in protection as targets unless they are first attacked by them.  They will also not attack Lindella again.</li>
    <li>New spell, That's No Cat, submitted by Nyx!  Additional credits go to Dakota Pond for idea and name, transformation description help by Berrie Valentine, and editing by Augustinus Tate.  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a cute, feminine-looking skunk boy.</li>
    <li>New spell, Exeunt Omnes, submitted by Varn!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a herm succubus demon.</li>

    <li>New spell, Return of the King, submitted by Varn!  Graphic is by BabblingFaces.  This spell turns its victim into an elvish bard.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 31</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lindella will now travel in a predefined route circling through the streets of the town.</li>
    <li>Some changes to the Psychopathic Spellslinger AI:  they now persistantly attack a target and will chase them down.  Bots will stop targetting players who go offline and it is possible to aggro a psychopath onto yourself if you attack them.  Because of this their stats have been significantly reduced.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 30</p>

<ul>
    <li>The link for player biographies does not appear on the Look At Player page unless the player actually has a bio now.</li>
    <li>Items you have equipped won't show up on the sell to Lindella list anymore.</li>
    <li>New spell, Sly Fox, submitted by Rayner!  Additional credits go to Luxianne and Mizuho for the concept.  This spell turns its victim into a Sly Fox Thief.  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Staff Fetish, submitted by <a href="http://www.lilysgames.com">Lily</a>!  Additional credits go to Elynsynos and Valerie.

    <li>New spell, Liquefy V2.0, submitted by GooGirl!  Additional credits go to Ani (proofreading), Arrhae (proofreading, author of the original goo girl and creative input).  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a pocket-sized goo girl kept as a pet.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Shadow Ditz, submitted by <a href="http://thegreatdaeo.deviantart.com/">The Great Daeo</a>!  This spell turns its victim into a Gimbo Stripper. Graphic is made by The Great Daeo himself.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Mommy Needs Panties!, submitted by <a href="http://www.lilysgames.com">Lily</a>!  Additional credits go to Elynsynos and Valerie.  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a pair of maternity panties to match the maternity bra.  Location-specific.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 29</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Alpha Round 8 has started.</b></li>
    <li>Changed the mana/willpower base per level so that each level gives a static +15.</li>
    <li>You can now write up a short character bio for yourself; you can find a link to do this on your Settings page.  You can view other players' bios on the Look At Player page if they have one.  Please use this for its intended purpose; random, off-topic, or inappropriate bios may be deleted.</li>
    <li>Higher level items gain less extra power per level; the bonus has been halved such that a level 12 item will double its bonuses instead of at level 6.</li>
    <li>Players who return to animate form from inanimation/animal forms should now return to the same form as when they first chose a player graphic.  (All starting forms have the same stats so this is merely cosmetic.)</li>
    <li>Made some changes to struggling so that missed updates counts as a full struggle action instead of .75 of one.</li>
    <li>Added some icons on the balance calculator to make it a little easier to find the bonuses by their theme (attack, defense, cleanse/meditate, etc).</li>
    <li>There is now a reminder on the proofreading page on load that reminds proofreaders that unless they save or discard changes, the copy will still be marked as checked out by them.</li>
    <li>New spell, Let's Make a Deal, submitted by Rayner!  Graphic is by Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a charming, handsome man who may offer a deal that doesn't seem as fair than what the receiver feels at first.  Region-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Shadow's Embrace, submitted by <a href="http://techhead0.deviantart.com">Techhead</a>!.  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a shifting star-studded cloak.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Put a Sock In It, submitted by Christopher!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a pair of knee-high socks.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>Added a covenant treasury system.  Members of a covenant can donate money to a covenant which the covenant leader can then distribute to its members as he or she sees fit.  There are a number of restriction on this to prevent abuse, including the following rules:
    <ul>
        <li>You need to be halfway to offline mode in order to donate Arpeyjis to your covenant.  This is to avoid last-minute panic money-dumping if a player feels threatened by an attacker.</li>
        <li>Only covenants with more than 3 animate players who are NOT in protection mode can have Arpeyjis sent to individual members.  This is to deter players from forming their own covenant to act merely as a personal bank.</li>
        <li>A small amount of Arpeyjis are lost when being gifted to a covenant member, currently 5% of the value.</li>
        <li>Amounts are sent in increments of 20, 100, or 500 Arpeyjis.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>The attack modal is now Ajax-based and will need to contact the server each time the attack button is clicked.  This should help speed up page load a bit and is in preparation for some larger code/databased-based changes in the future.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 26</p>

<ul>
    <li>My apologies for my absence and the long time between rounds; the last half of this week was spent moving and I've not had any time to work on this game.  As it stands now, the next round is planned to start sometime on Monday but I'll be running some open testing (chaos mode, in which I'll be actively pushing bugfixes and interfering with the game in order to fix bugs while giving players a huge amount of attacks per round) tomorrow.  Thanks for your patience!</li>
    <li>The end of round message is now just a banner notice at the top of the page rather than an alert box.</li>
    <li>New graphic for the Djinn Slave drawn by <a href="http://danaume.deviantart.com/">Danaume Rook</a>.  Authors and artists, please make sure to indicate which artist will be working on which graphics on the "Contributions Reviewed but Awaiting Implementation" page in order to avoid graphic duplications.  Thanks!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 22</p>

<ul>
    <li>Added a small graphic that appears in Transformania Time tabs, depending on your browser's settings.</li>
    <li>I have added three more chat rooms, RP1, RP2, and RP3 in addition to the regular old one (which is now known as the Global chat.)  Feel free to use the 3 RP rooms for group and realtime roleplaying purposes.  Please be civil and move to a different room if the one you are in has occupants who would like to keep their room free.  You can report players who abuse this in the game forums.  You can chat in more than one chat simultaneously; however, each room is in its own separate browser tab.  I am planning on adding more chat rooms as needed, and this may also lead to the ability to talk to the inhabitants of the location you are currently at, or a private chat exclusive to your covenant.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 21</p>

<ul>
    <li>Covenant leaders can now send out massages to its members.  This is available on the covenant administration page.</li>
    <li>Items now show a small lock next to their old human name if they are permanent.  Permanent items cannot struggle to regain an animate form ever again.  All bots that have been transformed recently (not all will be locked this round since I began working on this feature later) will show that they are permanent items.  Additionally, players who drop below %-160 chance to escape become permanent items/animals.  Players who are already below this threshold will not become locked in unless they perform a non-struggle action after this update goes out.  Recall that performing these actions reduces your probability to escape.</li>
    <li>Lindella pays more money for permanent items and puchases struggle-able items for less now.</li>
    <li>Added an "expand" button on the attack modal that makes it take up the full screen and increases the size of each link.  This is meant to help for mobile devices.</li>
    <li>Curses should now show the text when a player is hit by one (notably, Circine's Hypnosis added last night.)</li>
    <li>Players who reroll a new character should keep their old covenant and become its new leader.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 20</p>

<ul>
    <li>Curses (those specific to animate forms or those carrying particular items) now have balancing requirements.  The balancing calculator has a new option for curses that will require for you to enter in a duration; a long-lasting curse will obviously be less powerful per turn than short-lasting ones.  Right now the "ideal" balance is -400 after duration is factored in.  However, expect these numbers to change quickly.</li>
    <li>New spell, Vg'f Lbhe Freir!, submitted by themorpher606!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a nifty professional tennis racket (or racquet, depending on which part of the world you come from.)  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New curse, Sanguify, submitted by Izz Valentine.  This spell is useable by the Vampire Lord only  (though in the future the Seductive Vampire will gain it too.)  This is the first curse contribution added to the game and a lot will still need to be worked out.  Players currently in this form will not recieve the curse, only those who are transformed in it after this update.</li>
    <li>New spell, Ratticus Buckthievious, submitted by <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/user/draggony/">Draggony</a>!  Graphic is by Thrax (primary artist) with Tsubaki Mizu (added background).  This spell turns its victim into a sneaky rat thief who may just well have a female companion in the future.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Love Struck, submitted by Christopher!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a pair of heart-shaped sunglasses.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Fit to Be Tied!, submitted by <a href="http://martiandawn.deviantart.com/">Martiandawn</a>!  Additional credits go to Elynsynos for proofreading.  Graphic is by Meddle.  This spell turns its victim into a tied crop top.  Region-specific.</li>
    <li>New curse submitted by LexamTheGemFox.  This curse is randomly gained from searching a location.</li>
    <li>Just as a reminder, scripting of the game (item leveling scripts, character movement scripts, auto-refresh scripts, etc) are all officially against the rules of the game and known abuses may result in character or item deleveling or player deletion.</li>
    <li>Decreased XP gain from curses.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 19</p>

<ul>
    <li>XP that inanimate and animal players gain from rubbing, headbutting, now builds up over time the same as struggling to a maximum of 24 extra actions worth.  This only affects XP; the willpower/mana effect is not changed any by this.  The XP gain per action has been slightly decreased because of this and some calculations run against the database that show items are still, on average, leveling faster than players (and this time bonus update will probably make this worse.) </li>
    <li>A few bugfixes.  Most notably, items that struggle enough to lose a level should now actually do so instead of entering negative amounts of XP.</li>
    <li>New spell, Show Me Where it Hurts, submitted by Ashley Maid!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into some sorely-needed nurses.</li>
    <li>New spell, Happily Ever After, submitted by BlackTGKitty!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a sex-starved princess who sneaks out to make love to the common man--and possibly woman, too!  Location-specific.</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 17</p>

<ul>
    <li>Shifted the no-attack period from 30 seconds until turn update and 90 seconds after it starts.  Hopefully this should continue to reduce bugs when attacking.  In the future I may need to disable further action types during turn updates, though I'd prefer to avoid this if at all possible.</li>
    <li><b>The long overdue Effect Contributions are now fully up and running</b> (but of course I'm sure bugs will turn up.)  Proofreaders can now access all of the effect contributions and proofread them just as with the main spell/form/item contributions.  I'll give a bit of time for the proofreaders to look over all the contributions, but expect many of them to appear in the game relatively soon.</li>
    <li>The turn update message should vanish after no more than 90 seconds now.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 16</p>

<ul>
    <li>Not a game update but another fan-art shoutout to Luxianne who drew <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/art/Commission-Cowgirl-TG-Jess-Ganes-467919350">this comission</a> of player Jess Ganes transforming into the Curvaceous Cowgirl from this game.  (JBovinne created the first game fanart which I posted about back on June 15.  If you have something related to the game you'd like to share, please send me a message on the forums!)</li>
    <li>Shifted the no-attack time period from being restricted to the last and first minutes of a round.  This should give the turn update more time to run to completion and hopefully reduce the chance of server errors when players attack.</li>
    <li>Added some exception handling revolving around attacks that throw an error despite consuming a player's action points, an attack count, and mana.  Players who encounter this seemingly random bug may be reimbursed for these lost points if the server detects an error.</li>
    <li>There should now be a notice at the top of the page that says "TURN UPDATE IN PROGRESS" when the game is updating.  There's a good chance this won't go away after an update has completed since the flag won't get turned off if an exception is thrown during the update--keep an eye open for this happening.  There is now also greater precision shown on the turn update clock (which is still only available to fully animate players for the time being.)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 14</p>

<ul>
    <li>Owners of struggling pets and items should now receive notifications as well as the victim's percent chance of recovery.</li>
    <li>A few minor visual changes to the Contribution writing page to make it more apparent for the original author to tell which copy is the original and which is the proofreading duplicate.</li>
    <li>I've made a few basic pages that show off some of the most frequent contributors' graphics (authors will be included over time.)  You can find it here:   <a href="http://transformania-time.com.plumeria.arvixe.com/Contribution/ContributorBioList">Contribution Bio List</a>.  I will continue to add artists and author profiles over time.</li>
    <li>New spell, Make a Wish, submitted by <a href="http://danaume.deviantart.com/">Danaume Rook</a>!  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a highly magical enslaved female Djinn, a pet type transformation.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Make Love Not War, submitted by Varn!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a peaceful-loving (relatviely!) new age retro hippy.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>Added a graphic for the Playful Pussy item, drawn by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 13</p>

<ul>
    <li>Added a couple new fields to the Contributions page, a field where contributors can credit others who have helped out, either by providing ideas, proofreading, or more.  Because of this, please only write your own name, the primary author, in the old "What name do you want to be credited with?" input.  The second new field is just a place where the author and proofreaders can leave miscellaneous notes or ask questions, let me know when a contribution has been through a final proofreading pass, or anything else that is relevant.</li>
    <li>As a side note, I plan on working on getting blessing/curses contributions up and running soon.  My apologies that they have been delayed for so long, there are some considerations I have had in order for me to avoid building up technical debt down the line.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<P>July 12</P>

<ul>
    <li>Several bugfixes revolving around protection and non-protection players.</li>
    <li>Added a reserved name feature.  All players at level 3 or greater can reserve their current player name by going to the Settings page and clicking "Reserve Name".  Your reserved name is attributed to your membership ID and will persist between rounds and players.  It will stop another player from starting a round using your name if you have it reserved.  Keep in mind that if you start a new character and choose to reserve that new player's name instead of the previous one, your previous name becomes available again.</li>
    <li>Proofreaders can now discard their changes by clicking on a new link, "Unlock but DO NOT Save".  This will release the proofreading lock but not save any edits to the page.</li>
    <li>Players who are items or animals should now be able to reserve their name regardless of the level of their animate form.</li>
    <li>Items or animals struggling can now actually lose XP.  They will not have to surrender a perk, but neither will they be able to get a perk upon reclaiming that level (the available perks will show that the player has -1 perk instead of 0 to indicated this.)</li>
    <li>New spell, Hot for Teacher, submitted by Varn with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!  It should be pretty clear what this spell turns its victim into.  Region-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, It's Got Ruffles!, submitted by <a href="http://martiandawn.deviantart.com/">Martiandawn</a>   with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!  This spell turns its victim into a fluffy 3-tiered skirt.  Region-specific. </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 10</p>

<ul>
    <li>After the first day (144 hours) of the turn, covenants can only accept a new member once every two hours.  This is meant to stop covenants from frequently swapping members in and out.  This system may be replaced by a mandatory covenant-joining cooldown on the player who leaves in the future instead.</li>
    <li>Struggling to return to an animate form after having missed several updates will still raise the % chance of recovery for the time missed, though at a slightly reduced amount and only up to 6 hours at most.  Item and Animal XP gain will receive this in the future as well.</li>
    <li>You will receive a unique effect when returning to an animate form that makes it harder to attack and be attacked for 6 turns while you recovery your willpower and mana.</li>
    <li>Removed the RP icon next to names on the leaderboard since just about everyone has one.</li>
    <li>Players that reroll will now spawn at their old level - 3 instead of straight back at 1.  In the future they will be able to transfer some of their spells from the old player to the new one, but this is not implemented yet.</li>
    <li><b>Round 7 has officially begun!</b></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 9</p>

<ul>
    <li>As a reminder, the game is currently inbetween rounds and is active only for the sake of testing.  Next round is schedule to begin tomorrow, July 10 sometime between 6 and 10 pm EDT.</li>
    <li>Location logs older than an hour will be deleted at turn updates.</li>
    <li>Messages sent between players that are older than 72 hours will be deleted at turn updates.</li>
    <li>New graphic for the Lucky Lips spell provided generously by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!</li>

<p>July 8</p>

<ul>
    <li>Alpha Round 6 has ended!  Congratulations to Helia Harris for being the strongest spellcaster to end the game.  I can't give an estimate for when next round begins, but it will either happen between 5-10pm EDT on July 9th, or failing that, July 10th.  <b>I will announce when the next round officially begins.  The game is currently in a state of between-round testing.</b></li>
    <li>There are a number of important changes planned for next round.  <b style="color: red;">Most importantly, the distinction between PvP and non-PvP is being dissolved</b> and both game modes will converge back into one.  Here are some things to know:
        <ul>
            <li>All players will be able to struggle against inanimate or animal transformations.  The probablity of success now depends on what level you were when you were transformed.</li>
            <li>Performing an inanimate or animal action that is not struggling will make it harder for you to turn back in the future.</li>
            <li>Struggling will decrease your player's experience a few points, the exact amount scaling to your level.  It is impossible to lose a level, but you may find yourself with a negative amount of experience points, an extra amount to have to gain in order to get back on track.</li>
            <li>Struggling mechanics have changed a bit:  players start out with a negative percent chance to change back (which in effect means none).  However, each struggle largely increases the % chance of changing back.  Ultimately this means turning back will become more predictable and a bit less random.</li>
            <li>Players within the same covenant can cast spells against one another.  However, it will not earn them any experience points and there will not be a lump sum bonus if the victim is turned inanimate or into an animal.</li>
            <li>Inanimate spells will earn the caster less XP the higher level the caster is, similar to how the experience gained from animate spells diminishes at higher levels.  However, the XP diminishment does not happen until slightly higher levels.</li>
            <li>Players under level 4 are (for the time being) immune to inanimate and animal spells.  This will be known as new player protection.  I plan on giving players the option to opt out of this protection mode if they so choose.  Once a player is eligible for level 4, however, they must voluntarily leave protection for good in order to be able to gain any more levels.</li>
            <li>For this upcoming round I will not implement a hard cap on covenants.  However, due to strength in numbers, larger covenants may receive some semi-permanent curses that hinder their attack effectiveness to hinder their strength in numbers in relation to the size of the covenant.  These curses will be removable if the member count drops or be removed for a player only when he or she leaves their oversized covenant.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The willpower/mana increase gain from leveling up has been reduced.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 7</p>

<ul>
    <li>A couple new regions, the Eta Gamma Mu Sorority House to the southwest as well as some smaller nearby locations.  Writing credits for these go to Meddle, Lynn, Varn1234, and <a href="http://martiandawn.deviantart.com/">Martiandawn</a>.</li>
    <li>New spell, Your Highness, submitted by <a href="http://jbovinne.deviantart.com">JBovinne</a> with his own graphic!  This spell turns its victim into an Elf Princess.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Boobify, submitted by Swogrider with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!  This spell turns its victim into a pair of disembodied breasts that are worn as an undershirt.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Cyber Superiority, submitted by themorpher606 (Kevin Gates) with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>! This spell turns its victim into a calculating metal mechanic man.  Location-specific.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 6</p>

<ul>
    <li>Several minor bugfixes.  Notably, selling and buying from the vendor should not give the error screen anymore.</li>
    <li>New spell, Flower Power, submitted by <a href="http://foxpower93.deviantart.com/">Foxpower93</a>!  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a slow-moving but animate flower girl.</li>
    <li>New spell, Lucky Lips, submitted by Greg Mackenzie with credit for Fiona Mason for ideas!  This spell turns its victim into half-woman half-lipstick accessory.  Graphic is by me until/unless someone wants to make a better one.</li>
    <li>New region, the Blazes and Glamour Beauty Spa to the east.</li>
    <li>New spell, Hickory Dickory Dyke, submitted by Estyz with the idea and art by a new artist, Curry Senpai!</li>
    <li>New spell, Message in a Bottle, submitted by Zatur with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!  This spell turns its victim into a genie woman.</li>
    <li>New spell, Page Turner, submitted by Varn with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a magical textbook trapped within its pages.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li><b>If you have a contribution that was marked as approved but is no longer in the list, please notify me on the forums.</b>  Some contributions that have long since been approved did not show up because of a technical problem, and while I believe they should all be appearing again now I may have missed some by accident.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 5</p>

<ul>
    <li>My apologies for the lack of updates--between the holidays (in the United States) and preparing to move, I have not had much time for development.  I will try to get more spells in by the end of today.</li>
    <li>New spell, Winter is Coming, submitted by Alessandro Stamegna with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a> proof read by the Maids( Varn, Claire, Arrhae, <a href="http://martiandawn.deviantart.com/">Martiandawn</a>) And Elyn.  This spell turns its victim into an ice queen.  Location-specific.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>July 2</p>

<ul>
    <li>There has been a change to balancing.  Because of how easy it is to throw huge negatives into the statistics that have little to no penalty to being below 0, the calculator will only give half the amount of points when these values are negative.  These statistics are Sneak, Evasion, and Evasion Negation.</li>
    <li>New spell, Robotomy, submitted by Christine Winters with thanks to Arrhae, ToniV and Meddle for proofingreading!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into an accurate but vulnerable Hedonistic Fembot.</li>
    <li>New spell, Bull by the Horns, submitted by Christopher with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a strong minotaur.</li>
    <li>New spell, Day of the Tentacle, submitted by Varn with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a tentacle beast, a pet type.  Expect for this pet to have some nifty curses in the future.</li>
    <li>The items in Lindella's inventory are now filtered by type.</li>
    <li>Consumable type items in Lindella's inventory will get deleted on the update after 25 minutes of being in her inventory (the same length of time that items on the ground are.)</li>
    <li>Added a beautiful new graphic for Lindella drawn by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 30</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lindella can now purchased items from players.  She will not purchase pets or animals, howerver.  She will pay only 75% of an item's value when purchasing from you and only %50 of the item's value if it is a consumable item.</li>
    <li>Turning your victim into an animal or item will now give you some of their Arpeyjis.  If the victim is in PvP mode, the attacker collects half of the victim's total money.  If the victim is not in PvP mode the attacker only collects a fifth of the victim's money and an additional two-fifths of the victim's money is lost.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 29</p>

<ul>
    <li>It is now possible to find money (named Arpeyjis) when searching.  In fact, it is more likely to find money than items now.</li>
    <li>Lindella the Soul Vendor will now allow players to purchase items FROM her inventory.  Right now this is limited to the items she has turned players into.  She will not buy items from players yet but will be able to do so in a future update.  Item pricing will be tweaked greatly in the future.</li>
    <li>Lindella now has a few more spells.  She should always cast the same spell against the same person.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 26</p>

<ul>
    <li>Slightly raised the the probability of turning back to animate increase per inanimate / animal struggle made from .25% to .35%</li>
    <li>Some more internal changes to try and decrease memory footprint.  Also you may see a bot merchant spawn and wander the streets; at this point the merchant is not interactable (except for attacking her, which won't be easy.)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 25</p>

<ul>
    <li>Slight change to proofreading:  Whenever I approved a submission a proofreading copy is generated automatically.  Additionally, only proofreading copies are now listed among the contributions eligible for proofreading.</li>
    <li>Some various internal changes to try and lower the memory footprint of the game.</li>
    <li>Made some tweaks to the balance calculator.  There is now a "clear" button.  Additionally, there is now a button on the bottom of the page that says "generate code" that renders some text that.  <b>This is meant to be copy-pasted into the form / item / curse effects form on the database, which will make it a little easier for me to implement the spell and make sure I do not mix up some of the effect types.  Please start using this when balancing contributions.</b></li>
    @*<li>Made struggling as an inanimate or animal give a slightly greater % probablity of success increase for each struggle made.</li>*@
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 24</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Round 6 has begun.</b>  The new non-pvp options are live.  Also, as a reminder, <b>you are allowed to have both a PvP and non-PvP animate account at the same time now.</b></li>
    <li>Added several more levelup perks that can be earned at level 2.  These perks will replace their lower levels, not add on to them.</li>
    <li>All of the base male graphics have been replaced by new, much better renders made by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Thanks!</li>
    <li>New spell, Eye for Ra, submitted by Pharlynx, with a graphic by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>!  This spell turns its victim into an Egyptian priestess of Ra.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, A Goody Two Shoes, submitted by Arbitrary Hal with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a pair of leather shoes.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Dawn of the Ditz, submitted by Varn with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a bimbonic plague-bearer.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Bookwyrm, submitted by Julian Chance with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a small pocket-sized dragon pet.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Shell Out, submitted by Zatur with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a Cheerleader Shell (essentially a vest.)  Location specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Honey Pot, submitted by Rayner.  This spell turns its victim into an inanimate vagina that attaches to its wearer, replacing his or her current genitalia.  Location-specific.  (Note:  this previously had the graphic for Pussy Power.  It no longer does and does not have an ingame graphic for the time being.)</li>
    <li>New spell, Pussy Power, submitted by <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">LexamTheGemFox</a> with help from Laura Kitsu.  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a> and is location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Anthro Porcinus, submitted by themorpher606 with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into an anthro pig girl.  Location-specific.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 23</p>

<ul>
    <li>Non-PvP players can now be turned into items and animals.  These players will be given an opportunity to fight against their transformation and return to an animate human body, although the probablity starts out very low and slowly increases the more times the player struggles.  NOTE:  Players will still drop their items and release their pets for the time being.  Later on I will add the ability for players to fully reject inanimate and animal spells again and allow this to be a toggle-able setting.</li>
    <li>The new round is planned to start around 5 or 6 EST tomorrow, Tuesday.  <b>Right now the game is in blitz-test mode where everyone can attack freely and not part of an actual game round.</b></li>
    <li>Inanimate and animal actions earn 4 XP instead of 3 now.  Expect this leveling mechanism to change against in the future.</li>
    <li>There now should be 15 animate psychopaths out in the game world after an update instead of 10.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 22</p>

<ul>
    <li>Added the ability for covenant leaders to change their covenant descriptions.</li>
    <li>Added the ability for covenant leaders to kick out members of their covenant if they are misbehaving.</li>
    <li>"Good" animal actions should appear in blue in the player logs / notifications now.</li>
    <li>To stop abuse, items now store whether they are in PvP or non-PvP mode.  All this means in gameplay is that when there are consumeable-type items on the ground, you will only see items found from a PvP player searching for them if you are in PvP and non-PvP items when you are not in PvP.</li>
    <li>The leaderboard now shows which covenant a player belongs to, if any.</li>
    <li>To decrease abuse of the game mechanic, performing an action as an inanimate item or animal gives 3 XP per action instead of 5.</li>
    <li>There is a new level-up perk available at level 4 or greater, Master of Intimidation, that <b>REPLACES</b> the Intimidating perk (which has been renamed to Intimidating Glare).  In the future there will be more upgradeable perks.</li>
    <li><b>Notice for next round:  Non-PvP mode will be changing to allow for inanimate and animal transformations that are temporary.  Inanimate and animal non-pvp players will be given an additional option to "fight the transformation" and return an animate form.  The probability will start out very low that it will succeed but continued attempts will raise the probability of suceeding for each time in the future.  </b></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 19</p>

<ul>
    <li>More updates revolving around covenants.  In order to join a covenant, players must now apply and have the leader approve their application.  PvP players can only join PvP covenants and non-PvP players can only join non-PvP covenants.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 18</p>

<ul>
    <li>Made some more updates regarding covenants.  Not finished yet.  Note that I will be deleting all covenants at least one more time before I am finished with them.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 16</p>

<ul>
    <li>New spell, Sucker Born Every Minute, submitted by Christopher!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New region, the Sugarsand Station Candy Store, to the north.</li>
    <li>In an attempt to stop players from hitting targets with 6 spells in too short of a time frame, players can only attack within the first 7.5 minutes of a turn.  This might be handled differently in the future.</li>
    <li>The most rudimentary form of covenants are now in the game.  Right now there is a small list of premade, silly covenants to choose from and all it does is give you a bit of text next to your name to show which covenant you are in.  As I develop covenants more, they will be a) founded by players, b) limited to 8 players, and c) can only be entered by having an application accepted.  I'll be deleting all the current stuff before the next update with covenant material goes out.</li>
    <li>Tweaked the stats on the new Sucker Born Every Minute spell.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 15</p>

<ul>
    <li>New spell, It's the Thought that Counts, submitted by Berrie Valentine with a graphic by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  Location-specific!</li>
    <li>New spell, Help in high places, submitted by Christopher.  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location-speficic.</li>
    <li>New spell, Doll 'Em, submitted by plzTryMySpell, Ani, Arrhae, Haretia, et. al.  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a mannequin, but technically an animate one--a goelm.  Location-specific!</li>
    <li>Decreased the power of all submissiveness splash orbs a bit and made the stronger versions much less likely to find.</li>
    <li>Not really an update or anything, just wanted to share <a href="http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2014/165/8/f/what_i_ve_really_been_doing____by_jbovinne-d7mawvo.png">this piece of fanart by JBovinne</a>.</li>
    <li>There is now a new perk that you can select, Sharp Eye.  Unlike all other perks, this one has to direct effect on a player's abilities.  However, it does grant a 1AP discount when searching, which will help players find spells faster though at the cost of something that may be more useful later on in the round.</li>
    <li>Consumable-type items that have been left on the ground on a location for more than 20 minutes are eligible to be deleted during a world update.</li>
    <li>New spell, Spank'Me, submitted by Zatur!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location specific!</li>
    <li><b>You can now only take an item off after you have worn it for at least one update.</b></li>
    <li><b>Players with sneak below -25% will have a message on their "Look At Player" page detailing exactly where they are at all times until their sneak ability is improved.  Players will less than -50% sneak will have their times attacking that update shown, and players with less than -75% sneak will also display how many action points they have left. </b>  This is an attempt to deter players from lowering their sneak as once sneak drops below 0 there is no other penalty.</li>
    <li>There is now a public message system.  I will use this (try to remember to, anyway) to notify players before pushing an update.</li>
    
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 12</p>

<ul>
    <li>Two new items that can be found, Strong and Volatile Submissiveness Splash Orbs.  These are stronger but rarer variants.  Additionally, the existing Weak splash orb now does 15 damage instead of 10.  The strong does 30 damage and the volatile does 60 damage.</li>
    <li>New spell, Dairy Factory, submitted by <a href="http://sampleguy.deviantart.com">Sampleguy</a> with his own graphic.  This spell turns its victim into a lumbering milk cow.  Location-specific.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 11</p>

<ul>
    <li>Balanced the stats for a couple pets.</li>
    <li>Inanimates and pets should now have their messages link highlighted in pink when they have unread messages.</li>
    <li>Added a couple long-time players to the proofreading whitelist.</li>
    <li>The Psychopathic Spellslingers now have half of their extra abilities coming from a permanent, bot-only perk.  This means that they'll lose some of their power when transforming out of their original psychopathic spellslinger form into a different animate one, but not all.</li>
    <li>To proofreaders:  Contributions that are marked for contribution will now show when someone has opened it up.  This will let proofreaders know that someone may be working on proofreading the spell and you should wait until the lock goes away.  The lock is cleared whenever the contribution is saved, so if you load it up and close the tab, click back, etc, the lock will not be released--for the sake of others please don't leave locks locked!</li>
    <li>New spell, Valkyrja Run, submitted by Blood Knight!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location specific!</li>
    <li>Rebalanced Naughty Schoolgirl.</li>
    <li>New spell, Blue feather, submitted by Draggony!  Artwork is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  Location-specific!</li>
    <li>Some updates to the make new character page:  You can now see the character portrait when changing your base form in the dropdown.  In addition, there are 5 new female forms that replace the old 3 (you can't select the old ones anymore, but if you are currently in that form you'll stay that way until you are transformed).  All of these new graphics were made by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>--much appreciated!  The male graphics will be replaced later on.</li>
    <li>The action links for inanimates and animals are now disabled when you've already performed your action for the turn.</li>
    <li>The flashing "Game updated!" text on modern browser tabs should now flash for inanimates and pets.</li>
    <li>There are a few reserved names players are not allowed to use now.  These include Judoo, Testbot, and Psychopath since they have meaning past 'normal' player names.</li>
    <li>Last update of the night:  you can now see the leaderboards of all previous rounds by scrolling down to the bottom of the Leaderboards page.  Note that the links will either result in errors or return a totally random player--they do not correspond to any current players in the current round, round 5.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 10</p>

<ul>
    <li>Judoo Testbots have been renamed to Psychopath (random last name).  This will only apply to new bots that spawn from here on out.</li>
    <li>Rebalanced the cursed doll.</li>
    <li>Fixed the graphic for the new Mary Janes item.  The new graphic is also by Meddle, and there's a good chance you'll be seeing the original again later with a new spell entirely.</li>
    <li>New graphics for the spellweaver and willflower jawbreakers, contributed by the tireless <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!</li>
    <li>Thanks to Raspy Rescript from the forums for proofreading the Heavy Metal spell.</li>
    <li>New spell, Portent, submitted by Aidyn Bright with a graphic by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  Location-specific!</li>
    <li>Rebalanced a few animate forms.</li>
    <li>Your contributions that are live in the game now have a pink background to them.  There is now also a whitelist for proofreaders who have access to contributions marked as "ready for review" to make spelling and grammar corrections--this will save on some copy-pasting.  You can read more about how to become a proofreader here:  http://luxianne.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=61. </li>
    <li>New spell, Hairspray, submitted by Kirshwasser!  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location specific.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 9</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>Round 5 has officially started!</b></li>
    <li>AP now only regenerates at half rate when being filled into the AP reserves.</li>
    <li><b>Willpower and mana max has been changed.  They no longer are measured in an absolute number but a % of your level base.</b>  They have a new cost of 5 instead of 1 in the balance calculator--I decreased every existing form and item to 1/5th of the old absolute amount to get the percent amount.</li>
    <li>New spell, Bondage is Magic!, submitted by LexamTheGemFox!  Location-specific.  This spell turns its victim into a BDSM pony girl, a pet type.  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.</li>
    <li>New region, Valentine's Castle, located to the west.  The region was created by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne and Mizuho</a>. </li>
    <li>New spell, Heavy Metal, submitted by Faremann with a graphic by <a href="http://thurosis.deviantart.com/">Thurosis!</a>  This technological spell turns its victim into a robot girl.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Schoolyard Strut, submitted by Christopher with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!  This spell turns its victim into a pair of 5-inch Mary Janes.  Region-specific.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 8</p>

<ul>
    <li>My apologies for not having many updates lately.  I have been working on covenants, balancing, and general code maintenance, much of which has no visible effect on gameplay.</li>
    <li>Rebalanced some of the most used items and forms in the game using the balance calculator.  For the most part items that add a lot of extra willpower damage, tf energy, and critical hits have been reduced.  This process is still ongoing--I tend to target the most widely used items first.  <b>EDIT:  These balances have been reverted until the start of next round.</b></li>
    <li>Raised player level cap to 15.  Items can also level up to 15 as well.</li>
    <li>All of the spells that could be found anywhere are now location or region specific.  Additionally they now have a discovery message.</li>
    <li>Also as a reminder, the round is schedule to end tomorrow.  Round 5 likely won't start up until 6pm in EST.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 5</p>

<ul>
    <li>Added a new page to allow for player-submitted curses given to the player by either searching in a location or by a spell cast from a player in a specific form or with a certain item equipped.  You can go to this page through the "Submit New Content" page--there is a new link at the top of that page that says "Go to Curse contributions" that will take you to the new page.  <b>As always, back up your spell on your own computer in case a bug prevents it from saving or loses some of the contribution.</b></li>
    <li>Clicking on the Chat link opens the chat in a new tab.</li>
    <li>If you are an animal or item, you should now see your owner's portrait in the top-left area of your own portait.</li>
    <li>Rebalanced the Kitten Boi stats.</li>
    <li>The inanimating / animal XP lump sum now only takes place if your target is no less than 3 levels fewer than yours.  This means a lvl 9 inanimating a lvl 6 gets the XP bonus but inanimating a lvl 5 will not.</li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>June 4</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        You are now restricted to only 3 cleanses and meditates (together, not individually) per update.  There's some new styling on the main game page that shows how many times you have attacked this update, how many times you have cleansed+meditated, and how much money you have.  (Money is not in game yet, and it will be referred to by its currency name in the future.)
    </li>
    <li>There is a change to AP:  You can now keep up to 360 extra AP in reserve.  When the amount of AP you have in reserve is greater than 0, you can gain up to 20 extra AP at the turn update.  In effect, this means that a player who goes offline for 8 hours will have their AP restoration much higher until that reserve runs out.  Your AP reserve is only added to when your normal AP bar is at 120/120 and goes up 10 per turn, the usual rate.</li>
    
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 3</p>

<ul>
    <li>Oops... it shouldn't be possible to learn location-specific curses anymore.</li>
    <li>The adorable catboy now has a new graphic by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.</li>
    <li>Added 4 new form-specific curses for the Donkey Dominatrix, Enchanted Tree, Dainty Birdgirl, and Impossibly Big Breasted Lady.  Unfortunately players who are currently in these forms will not have these spells--they will need to get re-transformed into them before they learn them.</li>
    <li>Not an update but a note:  Wearing/Equipping particular items and taming pets will also grant unique spells that add curses to their targets in the future, so content authors keep in mind what some contributions might have in terms of cursing other players.</li>
    <li>For those of you in chat asking, spells that give curses require:
    <ul>
        <li>A spell it is cast from.  Write this like other spells except that these do not do damage any willpower or add TF Energy.</li>
        <li>An effect that is given to the target of the spell, which needs:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A unique name for the curse</li>
            <li>A text description of what it is like for the <b>target</b> when they <b>first receive</b> the curse.  Ideally 3-4 sentences.</li>
            <li>A text description of what it is like for the <b>attacker</b> when they <b>first give</b> the curse to their target.  Ideally 3-4 sentences. (not used yet for existing curses, but it will be)</li>
            <li>A text description of what it is like for the <b>victim</b> to <b>currently be carrying</b> the curse.  Ideally 2-3 sentences that state WHO did it to you (the type of form they were in, not an actual name of a player) and how it effects the victim.</li>
            <li>The effects of the curse:  for now these must be heavy weighted toward having negative effects to the player receiving the effect.  Try not to use more than 3 different buff/debuff types--keep it simple..</li>
        </ul>
        </ul></li>
    <li>I will be adding another Contribute page solely for effects at some point in the future to make the process easier.  In the mean time, send the new spells/curses to me via a PM using the new <a href="http://luxianne.com/forum/index.php">forums.</a>  I am also known as Judoo over there.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 2</p>

<ul>
    <li>Added some calculations in the world update logic that attempts to keep players' willpower and mana maximum amounts within proper levels appropriate to their level and willpower/mana maximum increase bonuses.  This should hopefully safeguard against players receiving a permanent bonus or penalty from a previously existing bug.  If your maximum willpower/mana suddenly nad inexplicably changes after a turn update, this is why.  <b>This is also the first step in a future plan to change maximum health/mana amount to be based on a percent value of your base rather than an absolute amount</b>.</li>
    <li>In case you hadn't noticed, there is a new link at the top of the page that says "Forum".  It links to <a href="http://luxianne.com/forum/index.php">here</a>, a forum for the game being hosted by <a href="http://luxianne.com/">Mizuho and Luxianne</a>.</li>
    <li>You can now see exactly how many minutes left until you go offline on your Setting page.</li>
    <li>Pets should teleport along with their masters now.</li>
    <li>Pets can now perform two more actions that affect the target's mana, Nuzzle and Headbutt.  Snarl now lowers mana instead of willpower--headbutt lowers willpower now instead.</li>
    <li>The attack modal is now color-coded:  there's a different color for the different mobilities of the target form.</li>
    <li>The first cast curse is now in the game.  The curse is Bimbo Kiss Bliss and is a spell castable only be Busty Blonde Bimbos.  When you turn into that form, you gain that spell but lose it when you are changed into something else.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>June 1</p>

<ul>
    <li>Update to contributions TOS:  I just wanted to flesh this out and make it clear to everyone how contributions work.  (Effective June 1, 2014)  When you post contributions and graphics, you retain your creator's rights.  This means the content cannot be resold or released for use on other websites or other electronic or printed mediums <b>by this site</b>--the contributor still has the rights to do so so long as it does not retroactively conflict with the game's use of the content.  However, you <b>are</b> agreeing to allow the game to use this content <b>indefinitely</b> so long as the game does not become a commercial project (no subscription fees, no pay-to-win item store, etc).</li>
    <li>Change to inanimate item leveling:  if you have multiple inanimate accounts and are leveling more than one up, the XP gain from an inanimate action is only as high as base XP (5) divided by the number of inanimate accounts under that IP address.  This is to help prevent abuse of the item leveling game mechanic.</li>
    <li>New spell, Purification, submitted by A /d/eviant with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Clothes Make the Man, submitted by Arbitrary Hal with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!</li>

    <li>New spell, Cat(boi) Scratch Fever, submitted by Aingelproject667!</li>
    <li>New spell, Heavy Artillery, submitted by Swog with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Much like the tree, this spell is technically animate but is unable to move.  You'll find out why soon enough.  Location specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Who Wears the Pants, submitted by Arbitrary Hal with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location specific.</li>
    <li>Added 4 new effects that can be gained from searching in certain locations.  Some are better than others.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>May 31</p>

<ul>
    <li>When turning into a different form, whether animate, inanimate, or pet, all of the transformation energy of that spell type is removed from your body.  This will stop players with less than half willpower from getting toggled back and forth between two animate forms and losing XP each time.</li>
    <li>It is now possible to gain a temporary effect from searching at certain locations.  These effects are like level up perks but are temporary and only have a limited duration of effect.  Once they expire they enter a cooldown in which that player cannot gain that effect again until the cooldown is also down to 0.  These effects will change their owner's abilities in both good and bad ways.  There are currently two such effects.  In the future temporary effects will also be obtainable via using findable items or having them cast by spells.</li>
    <li>The "My Perks" link has been renamed to "My Effects" and now shows any temporary effects on your body in addition to your levelup perks.</li>
    <li>Two new findable items, Spellweaver and Willflower jawbreaker candies.  These items restore your mana or willpower 5 for 6 turns.  Consuming one gives you an effect.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>May 30</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Updated the Contributions page a bit.  The bonuses list window now links to the calculator (clicking on that link should open the calculator in a new tab, but I don't know how mobile devices will handle this).  Additionally, I have added placeholders to various text areas to give a better idea of when to use first or third person pronouns.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed a bug so that players wearing items or pets that level up  give the owner the appropriate maximum willpower / mana changes.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>May 29</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Chat page now prompts you whether or not you want to leave the page before the tab closes.</li>
    <li>Two new twin spells, Dark Baptism and Mistress of the Night!  The first is by Blood Knight and the second by <a href="http://foxpower93.deviantart.com/">Foxpower93</a> with both of their graphics done by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  Both spells are location-specific.</li>
    <li>The Chat page should now notify you when it has lost connection to the server and will try to automatically reconnect.</li>
    <li>New spell, Dusty, submitted by Hanna!  This spell turns its victim into a feather duster.  No graphic yet (I think Meddle made one but I can't seem to find the file... oops!)  Location-specific!</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>May 28</p>

<ul>
    <li>New inventory graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.</li>
    <li>There is a new consumeable item you can randomly find, a Scroll of Teleportation that does what its name suggests.  The chance of finding one is rather rare and they are one-time use, but they allow the user to go anywhere else on the map instantly for no AP cost.</li>
    <li>New spell, Transformus Wandus, submitted by themorpher606!  Graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Captured Souls, submitted by Alessandro Stamegna and proof read by Elyn!  Graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New item, the Submissiveness Splash Orb (Weak).  This item is an area-of-effect attack, damaging all ONLINE players in the same location as you with the same PvP or non-PvP flag.  You can find these by searching as random pickups, but they are hard to find.  Note that even though these do not require any action points to use and do not increase your attack counter, it WILL bring out of offline mode as if you had spent action points.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>May 27</p>

<ul>
    <li>New region, the Treasure Chest, to the south.</li>
    <li>
        New spell, Slave to The Rhythm, submitted by <a href="http://redneckdemon.deviantart.com">redneckdemon</a> with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!  Region-specific.  Guess where...
    </li>
    <li>New region, Milton's Ranch to the east.  This location comes from a series of stories from <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">LexamTheGemFox</a>.</li>
    <li>New spell, Ass Master, submitted by <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">LexamTheGemFox & Hachik0048</a> with a graphic by <a href="http://danaume.deviantart.com/">Danaume Rook</a>.  Location specific!</li>
    <li>New spell, Dat Ass, submitted by <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">LexamTheGemFox & Hachik0048</a> with a graphic by Dominque!  Location-specific.</li>

<p>May 26</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>All players now have the option of opting out of PvP.</b>  When you create a new character now, you are given an option to start the game in PvP mode.  If you choose yes, the game works the way it has been for you.  If you choose no, you will not be able to cast Weaken or inanimate / animal spells against other players (but bots are still fair game, both in being transformed by you as well as trying to transform you back.)  You can choose to opt-in to PvP later on in the game by clicking on the new Settings link and enabling PvP there, but be warned that <b>once your account is in PvP mode, you cannot take it out of that mode until you start over with a new character.</b> 
        
        <ul>
            <br />
            Some differences between PvP and non-PvP:
            <li>
                In order to encourage players to play in PvP mode, players who start out in the mode get a levelup perk at game start.
            </li>
            <li>
                Players who do NOT start out in the game in PvP mode will receive half XP for casting spells.  If they opt in, XP gain will be returned to regular rates.
            </li>
            <li>
                Players who have their PvP flag enabled will have an icon next to their name on the main Play page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Only players who have their PvP flags enabled will appear on the Leaderboard page.
            </li>
            <li>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:  Non-PvP players cannot equip or pick up items higher than their own level.</li>
            <li>NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:  I will be removing the irrelevant spell links from the attack modal if you are casting against a non-PvP player and can only cast animate spells.  This is not implemented yet but will be added shortly.</li>
        </ul>

    </li>
    <li>New RP flag.  You can enable or disable this at will in the new Settings link in the main game window.  If you enable your RP flag, there will be an icon next to your name, similar to the PvP icon, indicating that you enjoy roleplaying and are open to offers for it.</li>
    <li>Round 4 has officially begun!  Start over fresh with a new player on equal footing with everyone else.</li>
    <li>Change to PvP vs non-PvP rules:  If you are not in PvP, you are not allowed to cast any spells against players who are in PvP, including animate spells.</li>
    <li>PvP players who turn another player inanimate or into an animal now recieve an XP bonus for the act equal to 15 times the victim's level.</li>
    <li>The XP loss when changing into a different animate form has been halved and is now equal to 2.5 times the victim's level.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        New spell, Vulpes Zerda, submitted by Elynsynos with a graphic by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>!  This spell turns its victim into a fox.
    </li>
    <li>New spell, Kiss of the Spider Woman, submitted by <a href="http://jbovinne.deviantart.com">JBovinne</a> with their own graphic!  This spell turns its victim into a female dryad.</li>
    <li>Some UI updates:
    <ul>
        <li>Instead of seeing the names of the items you are currently wearing on the main play page, you see small versions of their images instead.  You can get their names by hovering your mouse over them.</li>
        <li>Removed the Inventory link on the page:  click on the backpack image by the graphics for the items you are wearing brings you to the same page now.</li>
        <li>When you attack someone, a modal pops up listing your spells.  This should make the page load (slightly) faster.  This also is the start to being able to sort your spells by mana cost, partition them into inanimate / animate / animal spell types, and more in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Two new level-up perks:  Thick Skinned which adds resistance to spells and Natural Purifier which removes extra TF energy when cleansing.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>May 24</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        New game mechanic:  Level-up perks.  Every time you level up, you are allowed to choose one new perk that will permanently increase one or more of your abilities.  Right now there is only a small handful of perks all available at any level, but in the future you will be allowed to choose from new, more powerful perks when you reach higher levels.  A few things to note:
        <ul>
            <li>When you level up, you will see a link at the top of the page that says "Choose Level Up Perk!".</li>
            <li>You can only choose a perk once.  In the future, stronger perks may replace weaker ones as a form of skill-branching.</li>
            <li>Once you choose a perk, there is no way to change it.  New perks will be added over time, but I will not delete any old perks so players can choose the new ones upon request.</li>
            <li>Animals and items do not get perks when leveling up.</li>
            <li>You don't have to choose a perk right after leveling.  This also means that, since it is late in the round, as soon as this update goes live players can choose as many perks as their current level minus one.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added a item/form balance calculator.  You can try it out <b><a href="http://transformania-time.com.plumeria.arvixe.com/PvP/ContributeBalanceCalculator">here</a>.</b>  Although this calculator is implemented, the Cost/Unit amounts are very rough guesses I made last night and I would like to hear your suggestions on how these values should be changed.</li>
    <li>There is now a new way of seeing the effects of your form, items, and effects (effects are perks and temporary blessings/curses which are not yet implemented) on your inventory and Look At Player pages.  The information is now neatly organized into a color-coded table, much like the balance calculator.</li>
    <li>
        New spell, Bimborb Crystalis, submitted by Varn and Archita!  This spell has been awaiting implementation for a quite a while and was originally written by Archita with the concept revised and rewritten by Varn. Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!  This rather unique spell turns its victim into a six-inch-tall bimbo trapped in a crystal sphere and is a pet type transformation.  Location-specific!
    </li>
    <li>New spell, Pan's Pipes, submitted by <a href="http://martiandawn.deviantart.com/">Martiandawn</a> with a graphic by themself.  This spell turns its victim into a partygoing horny satyr straight from Greek mythology.  Location-specific!</li>
    <li>New spell, Spoogebringer, submitted by Blood Knight!  This spell turns its victim into a runic dildo.  Graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location specific.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>May 23</p>

<ul>
    <li>A couple bugfixes.  Please report it if you transform or are transformed into a different form but the message doesn't state %100 transformation.  Also, test bots attacking other players or each other shouldn't create duplicate items anymore.</li>
    <li>Added a graphic for the whip item.  Graphic is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>May 22</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Nerfed health and TF energy damage reduction on items that have them.  In the future the mechanics for these may chance in that they only negate EXTRA willpower/TF energy damage.
    </li>
    <li>Some tweaks to transformation energy mechanics:  In order to reduce sniping (stealing someone else's transformation at the last second and claiming the victim as an item or pet), when transforming your victim only your own transformation energies cast on the victim will count toward their final form.  HOWEVER, every transformation energy uniquely attributed to you will move to a general pool 3 hours after your last cast of that spell against that target.  So the total amount of transformation energy is the amount in the common pool in addition to your own recent energies.</li>
    <li>Turning into a different animate form no longer removes any TF energy on you.</li>
    <li>
        New spell, Sarmoti, submitted by Zatur!  This spell turns its victim into a white tiger.  Graphic by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>!  Location-specific.
    </li>
    <li>Added graphic for the Bondage Kitten magazine.  Graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.</li>

    <li>
        New spell, Curse of Straw, submitted by Rust with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a very powerful but very dangerous cursed straw doll that can move around by itself, technically as a pet.  Location specific.  Just as a general word of advice, be very careful before taming, and make sure you have some willpower to spare.
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Whipcrack, submitted by <a href="http://christytgcaps.blogspot.com/">Christie D!</a>  This spell turns its victim into a leather whip.  No graphic yet.  Location-specific.

    <li>
        New spell, Mirror, Mirror, submitted by Hanna with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a magical piece of jewelry worn as an undershirt.  Location-specific!
    </li>
    <li>Just as a reminder to content contributors, remember that <b>if the spell you are contributing is for an animal or item, use the form description input to describe what it is like being that item or animal</b>.  The item description input is where you write what an outside viewer would see you in your new item/animal form as--copy/pasting between the two fields is not correct and does not work.</li>
    <li>Added a couple new graphics for the Psychotic Spellslingers.  Made by myself until/unless someone makes something better.</li>
    <li>New spell, Crown of Order, submitted by Hanna with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a cute maid cap.  Location specific!</li>

    <li>Added an image for the fishnet stockings added yesterday.  Graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.</li>
    <li>Replaced the Kitsune Shrine Maiden with a newer one by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a> with Meddle's blessing.</li>
    <li>Fixed a couple bugs with feral animals.</li>
    <li>Added a new region, the abandoned Erie Estate, to the northeast.  This is the largest region to date, and in the future it may be moved elsewhere.</li>
    <li>New spell, Witch's Friend, submitted by Blood Knight with a graphic by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>!  Region-specific.</li>

<ul>
    <li>
        Bots should have a slightly different background when listed on the main play page.  Soon they will have 'normal' randomly assigned named instead of all being named "Judoo Textbot#".
    </li>
    <li>
        New region, the Sunnyglade Public Pool, to the south.
    </li>
    <li>New spell, It's a Trap!, submitted by <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">LexamTheGemFox</a> with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Region-specific.</li>

    <li>Another new spell, Jungle Fever, submitted <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">LexamTheGemFox</a> with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This one is location specific, so good luck finding it!</li>
    <li>
        Yet another new spell, this time by Medli with a graphic by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>!  Also location-specific.
    </li>
    <li>New spell, Sea of Frills, submitted by Hanna with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Sgnikcots Tenhsif, submitted by Zatur!  No graphic yet.  Location specific.</li>
    <li>New region, the Extended Universe Comics Store, found to the north.  It might just be home to a new spell.  Hint hint.</li>
    <li>There should now always be at least 10 bots in the game at a time.</li>
</ul>

        New spell, Mon Lupe, submitted by Alessandro Stamegna.  This spell turns its victim into a pet wolf.  Location-specific, so good luck finding it.  Graphic is by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>!
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed a bug that let inanimate bots still attack players... oops!
    </li>
    <li>
        Various update to bots:  Bots won't attack themselves anymore (but they will attack other bots.)  Bots will no cleanse and meditate if their willpower/mana is low enough.  Bots have new, unique forms called Psychopathic Spellslingers that they start out with.  In the future, these bots will be immune to animate spells.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added white shadow to the sleep icon to help make it more visible against darker portraits, similar to the level number.  You may need to do a hard refresh for this to take effect.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>
    May 16
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Fixed a bug that kept certain items from being able to be found when searching.  This means it should be much easier to find spellweaver plants.
    </li>
    <li>
        Various, random updates tonight, largely bugfixes and refactoring some code in preparation for AI-controlled characters in the future.  If you meet and get attacked by someone named something like Judoo Testbot#, you just ran into these aptly named test bots.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>May 14</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Added a page to lists planned features for the game.  This can be found on the Game News page.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Contribution page has a new field that allows the submitter to specify whether or not they have an artist lined up for the spell or not.  If you do not have anyone particular in mind and want to let it go up for grabs, leave this field empty.
    </li>
    <li>Inanimate and Animal game over pages can now see the date of the last published update.</li>
    <li>
        There are now 3 new possible effects from your form and items:
        <ul>
            <li>Willpower resistance percent when hit by a spell (a 7% bonus means you take 7% less total willpower damage).</li>
            <li>Transformation energy resistance percent when hit by a spell (a 7% bonus means you take 7% less total transformation energy).</li>
            <li>Extra inventory spaces.  This will always round down.</li>
        </ul>
        Keep these in mind when writing new spells, and if you want me to change some of the existing spells' stats around, let me know as some of you have been requesting these.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can now no longer move if you are carrying more than the maximum amount of items in your inventory.  (You can get more than the max inventory size if you take something off.)
    </li>
    <li>Tweaked the stats of the were-leopard spell, silk top hat, masquerade ball mask, and cocktail dress.  The last three spells use the new bonus types.</li>
    <li>The tab for the game should blink if it detects that there has been a server updated.  Make sure you are playing from the URL http://transformania-time.com.plumeria.arvixe.com/PvP .</li>

        New spell, Maidus Bindus, submitted by Haretia with special thanks to Arrhae for checking the spelling and the grammar.  The contributor has requested that I not reveal the effect of this spell, so all I will say is that it is location-specific.  Happy hunting!  (No graphic yet).
    </li>

    <li>
        Fixed a bug that stopped maximum willpower and mana from changing when equipping or unequipping items that should have been doing so.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a graphic for the Masquerade Ball Mask, made by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
        Another new spell, Reflecius Fabricos, submitted by Haretia with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a sparkly cocktail dress.  Location-specific.
    </li>

    <li>
        Yet another new spell, Adorable Mouse Trap, submitted by <a href="http://danaume.deviantart.com/">Danaume Rook</a> with her own graphic.  This spell turns its target into a crossdressing adorable mouse boy!  Location-specific!
    </li>
    <li>
        Yet another another new spell, Lloth's Caress, submitted by XanKitsu with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a seductive Drow Priestess.  Location-specific.  Last spell for the night.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>May 12</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Fixed a bug that reduced willpower to offline players by only 25 percent instead of the full 75 percent.  (TF energy had the reduction correct from a past fix.)
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Enmaiden, submitted by <a href="http://tracitwist.tumblr.com">Ellipsis</a> some time ago.  Graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location-specific, so good luck finding it!
    </li>
    <li>
        Changed some server code so that spells can load text from XMLs.  This means much longer spells are now acceptable and shouldn't have a long-turn server cost, which was one of my concerns from earlier regarding long spells.
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Masked Soul, by Haretia.  This spell turns its victim into a masquarade ball mask.  Region-specific.
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Haute Couture, submitted by Hanna with a graphic by Graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Region-specific!
    </li>

    <li>
        Fixed a bug where pets weren't moving with their owners and only saw / could interact with the location where they were transformed.  Changed the "Look at Player" page for animals to go to the inanimate version, though modified to represent the fact it is an animal instead of an item.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added some functionality for the Contributions Awaiting Inclusion page.  A handful of select artists are now able to change the status message on each spell.  This is so artists can write down whether or not they want to do that graphic, how far along it is / if it is done, or any other relevant related news.  Right now the artists are limited to Luxianne, Meddle, and Danaume (and Nymic-TF, as well as Wrenzephyr, will be added soon.)  If you are an artist willing to contribute to the game, get in contact with me and I'll add you to the whitelist.
    </li>
    <li>The friends page should now show which friends are animals.</li>
    <li>
        Each item/pet in your inventory that was once a player now has a clickable link for "formerly [Name]".  This link take you to the Look At Player page, which then allows you to message them without searching for their name first.
    </li>
    <li>
        You should now see your own name in blue on the Chat page.  This also applies the first instance in a chat when someone writes out your full name in their message.
    </li>
    <li>
        Updated the How to Play page and added a new section at the bottom that lists tips for new players.
    </li>

        New spell, Hay Fever, submitted by <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">LexamTheGemFox</a> and Hachik0048!  This is the first animal-type transformation in the game, but more will be along shortly.  Location-specific, but because I want to test this out quickly, I'll tell you all that the spell is found in the veterinary clinic of Saint Circe's Community College.
    </li>
    <li>
        Tamed and released animals should now have a message in their player logs upon these actions.  Animals can earn XP and level up now, just as inanimate players can.  Added some more world statistic features to the animal endgame screen including world population and last server update clock.  Animals can now also see the map.
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, HEY! LISTEN!, submitted by Varn.  This spell turns its victim into a fairy familiar (which acts like a fairy/pet).  Location-specific, so happy hunting!  And oh, by the way, there's a new location somewhere...
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a link on the Contributions page that allows you to see what spells have been written up, admin-approved, and whether or not an artist has created / will soon create / is creating a graphic for it.  In the future, artists will be able to edit this page in order to "claim" a spell to work on its graphic.  This is to hopefully avoiod spell duplication or general confusion, both in spell theme and artists working on their graphics.
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Brutemaker, submitted by Varn with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell is unique in that it is the first animate spell to turn its victim into a male animate form!  Region-specific, so happy hunting!
    </li>
    <li>
        Tweaked the Busty Blonde Bimbo so that she now delivers 20 percent extra willpower damage from her spells.
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Wail of the Were-Leopard, submitted by Alessandro Stamegna with a graphic by <a href="http://luxianne.deviantart.com/">Luxianne</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a were-leopard.  Location-specific.

        Sorry there haven't been any updates for the past few nights, and there technically isn't one now, just a news status.  I've been busy working on full animal / pet transformations.  While coding is essentially finished for basic functionality, <b>I won't be publishing any updates until the start of Round 3 to prevent unexpected bugs / server bugs / etc while I'm busy over the weekend.</b>  If you are a contributor and would like to be among the first to write up a pet type, know this:
        <ul>
            <li>Animals work similar to objects--they give bonuses to whoever has tamed them and is keeping them as a pet.</li>
            <li>Animals are either feral or are pets.  Feral animals can move around as they please but pets always move with their owners.</li>
            <li>Animals can see what is going on at the location they are at.</li>
            <li>Players can choose to release a pet at any time.  Taming is instaneous, similar to picking up an item.</li>
            <li>Animals can either snarl or lick any players in the same location as them, including their owner, once per update.  This will give or remove a small amount of willpower to the target of the action.  Later on animals will be given a couple more custom actions that influence mana.</li>
            <li>Player can't cast spells at animals.</li>
            <li>Being turned into an animal is 'game over' state, and the player will be permitted to start over as someone else just as if they'd been turned inanimate.</li>
            <li>A player can only have one animal as a pet at a time.  You can't keep a pet in your inventory--they are either your pet or are feral.</li>
            <li>Animals won't be able to earn XP and level up at first the way inanimates can, but this will be a high priority for me to program in.</li>

        </ul>

    </li>
    <li>
        Also, as a reminder, the round ends at turn 2000, which is scheduled for sometime this upcoming Sunday.  The highest player on the leaderboard will be declared the winner of Alpha Round 2.  Round 3 will begin later in the day based on my availability.
    </li>

<ul>
    <li>
        The browser tab for the chat page should update with the number of unread chats when the page does not have focus.
    </li>
    <li>New spell, Fox Fire, submitted by Elynsynos with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a kitsune.  Location-specific.</li>
    <li>
        New spell, For Your Amusement... Park, submitted by <a href="http://whiteflamek.deviantart.com/">WhiteflameK</a>!  This spell is a little darker in tone and transforms its victim into a miniature carousel horse.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a white shadow to the level icon on character portraits, which should help the number appear better against dark backgrounds.  You may need to do a hard refresh for this to take effect.
    </li>
    <li>
        New location in the Saint Circe's Community College area, the athletics field.
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Cheerus Leaderious, submitted by Haretia!  This spell turns its victim into a chatty cheerleader.  Location-specific.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is a now new different page used when looking at inanimate players.
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Lingerie Inveigh, submitted by PsychoticPie with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into stocking-panties lingerie.  Location-specific.  Unlike the past spells this location of this may not be terribly obvious, so good luck finding it!
    </li>

<ul>
    <li>
        New spell, Glass Cannon, submitted by PsychoticPie with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  This spell turns its victim into a pair of glasses.  Region specific.
    </li>
    <li>
        The vibrator should now work properly by both adding mana and removing willpower.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spells listed below a player on the main game page are now listed alphabetically.
    </li>
    <li>
        Findable items now have weighted probabilities of being found.  This means it is twice as likely to find a dry spellweaver/willflower petal than it is to find a fresh one.  I have also added a couple new findable consumeables, willflower and spellweaver plant roots, which restore 40 willpower or mana (but is also harder to find than fresh petals.)
    </li>
</ul>

        New spell, Liquify, submitted by Arrhae with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!  This spell turns its victim into a goo girl.  Location specific.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a new region, Dr. Hadkin's Research Clinic to the east.
    </li>
</ul>

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Added a new ingame chat.  The chat is global, so the room is shared amongst everyone currently in the game.  The chat does not save any text, so when you close the page your browser will clear the chat window.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>
    April 30
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        New images for the spellweaver and willflower petals by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed a bug/exploit that allowed players to cast spells against themselves.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a new graphic to the main game page that shows when the last server update ran to hopefully give players a better idea as to when the next update will be.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 29</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        New spell, Vibrating Vex, submitted by PsychoticPie, with a graphic by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!  This spell turns its victim into a purple vibrating dildo, a reuseable consumable item with a relatively small cooldown, though at a small price...  Location-specific, so good luck finding it!
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 28</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Inanimates who stay inanimate and gain experience now see how far along to the next level they are.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added some more links to the inanimate page.  Also fixed/changed the link to friends who are inanimate on the friends page.
    </li>
    <li>
        New region, the Saint Circe Community College to the west.
    </li>
    <li>Two new spells, Schooltop Bop and Schoolbottom Bop, both submitted by PsychoticPie with graphics by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!  These spells spell turns their victims into a schoolgirl top and skirt, respectively.  Region specific.  But given the update listed above this, I doubt any of you won't know where to search.</li>
    <li>
        Another new spell, coincidentally along a similar theme:  Studious Sucker, submitted by TG captioner <a href="http://christytgcaps.blogspot.com/">Christy D</a>!  3d render is by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>.  Location-specific!
    </li>
    <li>
        There is now a chance that searching an area will give you some XP if you don't find anything else.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Round 2 has started!</b>  Create a new character and start off at level 1 on a fair playing field.  Happy hunting!
    </li>
    <li>
        Hotfix for the friends page. Only friends who currently have a player in the game are listed, so if you don't see a friend listed yet, don't worry.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are in the top 100 on the leaderboards, the row with your name will be highlighted.
    </li>
    <li>
        When looking at a player, you can no longer see the links to message them or request them as a friend if they have chosen to start a new character.  You can also use this to check whether or not your inanimate belongings have chosen to start over or are still around.
    </li>
    <li>
        Players are now listed in order of their level on the main game page.
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Willen Dorfus, submitted by Varn1234.  This spell turns its victim into a fertility idol.  Region-specific, so good luck finding it!
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Take Root, submitted by Sherry Gray.  This spell is very unique in that its victim is animate... technically.  She probably won't be winning any marathons soon, however.  Region-specific.
    </li>
    <li>
        Inanimate objects, should they choose to stick around and heep inhabiting their object-bodies, are now able to level up and earn XP.  This means if you make good friends with your owner or belongings, they might just help you out even more by ensuring your gear is up to par levelwise.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a new bonus type:  Extra willpower damage per spell cast percent.  This works like the extra TF energy bonus except it damages your victim's willpower in greater amounts.  This does not have an effect in game, but it will very shortly, so when writing up new contributions keep this in mind.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added another new bonus type:  Extra TF energy percent reduction when cleansing.  This will remove more or less TF Energy when a player who has this bonus cleanses.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added another new bonus type:  Misfire chance percent reduction.  This will decrease (or increase, if the given value is negative) the chance of a spell misfiring.
    </li>
    <li>
        When you search and find something with a full inventory, you will drop that item you just found rather than something else in your inventory.
    </li>
    <li>
        New graphic for the fertility idle, submitted by <a href="http://www.renderotica.com/artists/Meddlesom/Gallery">Meddle</a>!
    </li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 26</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Several new graphics for various items, submitted by Meddle and Nymic-TF.  Thanks!
    </li>
    <li>
        Some XP tweaking:  You will no longer earn negative 0 xp for casting against significantly weaker players.  There is also a cap of 15xp gain per spell cast.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a /2000 to the turn counter on the game's front page to better indicate that there is a maximum turn number.  When the game hits turn number 2000, it will no longer update.  Players can still spend any remaining XP and cast their 3 remaining attacks.  When I am next available, I will reset the world and open the game back up for the beginning of round 2.  Whoever has highest level and XP earned, whether animate or inanimate, will officially be the round "winner".  (I plan on adding a 'top 100' page that shows you exactly which players are in which positions.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a new Leaderboard page that shows the top 100 players in the round.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed a bug that did not give or take away the extra willpower and mana bonuses from an item's level when equipping or unequipping it.
    </li>
    <li>
        When you are replying to a message, you will see the text of the message of your are replying to above the input field.  In the future this may be expanded on to allow for the past 10 (or some number) amount of replies.  Also did a bit of restyling for the messages page.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 24</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Added a very basic friend system.  You can send a friend request by clicking on the "Request Friendship" link on the Look At Player page.  You must wait for that player to approve or reject the friendship offer.  If they approve, you can see when that player is online or offline as well as what the name of their most recent character.  Beside each accepted friend is a number--this number is linked to their account and not a particular player.  As such will persist between rounds and different player character within a round should the friend start over with a new player.
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Tip of the Hat, submitted by Zatur!  This spell transforms its victim into a stylish silk top hat.  Region-specific, so happy hunting!
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 23</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Two new graphics, one for the Black Latex Bra and the other for the Cat Ear Headband.  Both of these were rendered by <a href="http://mbirdcz.deviantart.com/">MadBirdCZ</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed a bug regarding skill evasion negation.  Also fixed a copy-paste error for the 1st person female black latex bra spell.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed a bug that let you learn location-specific spells if you already knew all the spells from the region you searched in.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added ten new locations, some streets extending to the west, as well as a new region, the Sweater Girl Gym.
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Sneaker Shot, contributed by PsychoticPie!  This spell turns its victim into a pair of athletic sneakers.  Region-specific.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />


<p>April 22</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Minor changes:  Tweaked the stats of the new Black Latex Bra.  Renamed the horsecock item to be "Prosthetic Horsecock" instead of a duplicate of the spell name.  The percent negation statistics should show up in bonus summaries and item descriptions now.  Made a small tweak that should help locations with many players load a bit faster.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can now see which spells are inanimate on your "My Spells" page.
    </li>
    <li>
        I have decreased the scale of how much less XP you gain for animate spells a bit, making it a little easier to earn XP at higher levels again.
    </li>
    <li>
        Attack now also disabled when you do not have enough mana to cast that particular spell in addition to when you are out of AP or have attacked the maximum amount per turn.
    </li>
    <li>Added a new spell, Hanging Around, submitted by CCWS!  This spell transforms its victim into a long tie which also serves to negate your victim's evasion chance (though as both this item and the black latex bra are undershirt item types, you can't wear both at once.)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 21</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The cumulative spell evasion statistics should be be gathered up in the form / inventory bonus summaries.
    </li>
    <li>
        Three new game elements that I've introduced to try and discourage animate-farming:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The higher level a player is, the less experience they will earn from casting animate spells against other players.
            </li>
            <li>
                You now lose 5 * your level XP whenever you are transformed into an animate form.  However, you will never lose a level nor drop below 0 xp.
            </li>
            <li>
                Additionally, a player who has just changed into a different animate form will have their currently amount of mana halved.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a graphic for the SQUEAK! spell.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Contribution page should be a little more stable now as the method of submitting the post is now POST rather than GET.  Let me know if this works out any better.
    </li>
    <li>Fixed an evidently longstanding bug that took your extra chance to critical hit from your target instead of yourself.  D'oh! </li>
    <li>
        You will now only see the last 20 messages you've sent, rather than all of them from all time.  This should help the page load up faster for those who like to roleplay and use the messaging feature extensively.  In the future I will also have the game delete messages that are older than a certain amount of time--I'm thinking 2 days.
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Pirate's Curse, submitted by Scipio Africanus!  This is an animate spell and turns its victim into a busty pirate wench.  Location-specific, so good luck finding it!
    </li>
    <li>New spell, Morpheus Phallus Equus, submitted by Varn1234!  This inanimate spell is rather unique as it turns its victim into a prosthetic, 18-inch horsecock!  Region-specific.</li>
    <li>New spell, Atexlay Abray submitted by dedicated role-player Arrhae!  This inanimate spell turns its victim into a black latex bra.  It is the first item to use the evasion negation bonus, which serves to counteract your target's evasion bonus when casting spells against them.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 20</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Renamed all of the streets.  This new naming system should be a bit less convoluted.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed a rare bug where a transformed player (in this case me!) was turned into 2 items instead of just 1.
    </li>
    <li>New spell, Brief Blaster, contributed by PsychoticPie.  Male players should appreciate this spell as it transforms its victim into a pair of boxer briefs.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 19</p>

<ul>
    <li>Added a new spell, Bovine Bounty contributed by Sun Bro.  This spell turns its victim into a bovine cowgirl.  Region-specific.  The portrait is by <a href="http://wrenzephyr2.deviantart.com/">Wrenzephyr2</a>.</li>
    <li>Added a new spell, SQUEAK!, contributed by <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">LexamTheGemFox</a>.  This spell turns its victim into an inflateable spell doll which, when used, restores its owners's willpower much like how the flask restored mana.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 18, 2014</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You can now look up other players in the messages page by searching for their name.  If a player by that name is found, you can then send them a message directly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bugfix:  An inanimate player taking an action against its owner no longer resets the wearer's offline 1 hour timer.  Oops... sorry!
    </li>
    <li>Made a bunch of spelling/grammar/copy-paste fixes thanks to the efforts of Eregho of the TF Games forum, as well as all who have submitted text to the Great Wall of Grammar.  I've only done this for the animate forms so far--inanimates still need to be revised.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 17, 2014</p>
<ul>
    <li>The button that shows offline players in a location should now show the number of offline players in that location, not online ones.  Oops.</li>
    <li>You should now see the offline icon in your character portrait at the top of the main page when you are offline.</li>
    <li>Swapped out my old rendered graphic for the Sexy Succubus form with a new graphic by <a href="http://nymic-tf.deviantart.com/">nymic-tf</a>.</li>
    <li>New spell, Meow Remix, by <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">LexmTheGemFox</a>!  This spell turns the target into a raver catgirl.  The graphic was created by another great artists on Deviant Art,  <a href="http://wrenzephyr2.deviantart.com/">Wrenzephyr2</a>!  Region specific.</li>
    <li>
        New region, the Oldport Concert Hall.  You can find it to the east.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can now see a list of your sent messages on the Messages page.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 16, 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed a rare bug where a player's location log would not be listed chronologically.  Similarly, location logs should no longer do this.</li>
    <li>Added a link to view your owner for inanimate players, as well as a direct link to message them.  The link to view your messages on this page now also lists how many unread messages you have.</li>
    <li>The Self-Refilling Silver Whiskey Flask should now restore extra mana based on its level.</li>
    <li>The requirements for offline mode have changed.  <b>You are now offline after 60 minutes of not attacking, meditating, cleansing, and moving.</b>  This means you can exchange messages freely without putting yourself back into online mode.</li>
    <li>
        Inanimate players now have four basic ways of physically interacting with their owners if they currently have one.  These actions ever so slightly raise or lower the owner's willpower or mana.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 15,2014</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        4 new graphics by <a href="http://nymic-tf.deviantart.com/">nymic-tf</a>!
    </li>
    <li>
        New spell, Udder Delight, by Varn1234.  This spell transforms its victim into magical detachable udders!  Region-specific.
    </li>
    <li>
        Spells can now be found in specific locations rather than regions.
    </li>
    <li>
        It should now be impossible to learn a spell that you already knew.  The spell learning heirarchy now goes like this:  1.  Learn spells specific to the location you are at.  If there are none left, 2.  Learn spells specific to the region you are at.  If none left, 3.  Learn spells nonspecific to any region.  At this point you have either learned every spell in the game (good for you!) or need to find spells that are at specific locations or regions you have not searched at.
    </li>
    <li>New spell, Mousy Time submitted by Elynsynos.  Location-specific.  This spell turns its victim into a catnip mouse toy.</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 14, 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Offline damage reduction is now %75 less damage.  I mistakenly made it %25 instead last night.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a new region, the Oldoak Apartment Complex, with four locations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Only online players now show up in a location by default.  You can see the rest of the players in that location by clicking a button that says "Show Offline Players".  This should help de-clutter the page when you are trying to find someone.
    </li>
    <li>
        Changed the cooldown on the Self-Refilling Silver Whiskey Flask from 95 turns down to 40.
    </li>
    <li>Edited the bonuses of the Sexy Succubus form.</li>
    <li>
        Added a new animate spell, Mutt Magic.  It turns the victim into a dog-girl in heat.  Region specific.  Graciously contributed by <a href="http://lexam-the-gem-fox.deviantart.com/">LexmTheGemFox</a>!
    </li>
    <li>
        There is now an link on the "your messages" page that allows you to communicate with whoever is wearing you (if anyone is--you might also be on the ground somewhere.)
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a graphic for Mutt Magic, an original drawing by LexmTheGemFox from their Deviant Art account.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a map page.  You can go to it by clicking on the "Map" link at the top of the main game page.  Streets are outlined in a light gray and the location where you currently are is has a light pink background.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 13, 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Based on feedback from the TF Games forum, you now recover 10 action points per update and can store up to 120 (two hours worth of accumulation.)  This is to help speed the game up.
    </li>
    <li>
        The offline damage reduction has increased from %50 to %75, so casting a spell will only have %25 of the effects that it would being cast against an online player.
    </li>
    <li>Added several more locations in the Sunnyglade Park region.  The world is far more populated than I anticipated (ideally each location will only have a relatively chance of someone being there) so I will work on adding a lot more locations.</li>
    <li>You can now see how many times you have attacked during an update by your willpower/mana/XP/action point bars.</li>
    <li>If you fully transform your victim into something inanimate and your inventory is not full, the new item will go straight into your inventory.  If your inventory is full, it will fall to the ground as before.</li>
    <li>New spell, Hellfire, contributed by Varn1234 of the TF Games forums.  Region-specific... good luck finding it!</li>
    <li>Added a few more street locations branching off to the east.  There will be a new region there soon.</li>
    <li>Another new spell, Cat Ears - Nya!, also contributed by Carn1234 of the TG games forums.  Also region-specific.  This spell turns its victim into a cat ear headband and is the first "hat" type item in the game.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where the wrong gender-specific transformation messages were being shown when you were casting against another player.</li>
</ul>

<hr />


<p>April 12, 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Reset the world and opened it up for public registration.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is now a world turn counter at the top of the page showing how many updates have passed this round.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 10. 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Added a new spell, Booze Baroness.  This is an animate transformation.  Region specific but the name is a pretty big hint.
    </li>
    <li>
        Raised the maximum amount of storeable action points to 36, which will go from 0 to max in two hours.
    </li>
    <li>
        Players that are at the maximum amount of action points are considered to be offline.  <b>This means that, for now, the willpower loss, transformation energy increase, and xp gained are all halved when casting spells against that player.</b>  I'm not sure if I'm happy with this--down the line I might change this logic so that your offline player will counterattack with Weaken or run away, or possibly some combination of the three.  <b>You can see which players offline by a "ZZZ" icon in the bottom-left of a character's portrait on the game's main page.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        These updates are inching towards a public alpha opening.  When that happens, <b>remember that the world will be reset.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Level icons do no longer show for one-time-use consumeable items or items with level 0 (which should have only been given to consumeable item types anyway.)
    </li>
    <li>Added two more locations within the Smelly Sorceress Tavern (did this a couple days ago).</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 7. 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        There is now a new section to the inventory and look at player pages that shows all of the currently worn items with graphical representation on where they are worn on the body.  This should make it a little easier to see what you are wearing at a glance.  The full, detailed list will still appear below.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 6, 2014</p>

<p>Sorry I haven't updated much--it's been one hell of a week at my job so I haven't had much time or motivation to program at home.  I'll try and step it up this week as I prepare on opening the alpha up to anyone who wants to play.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Added a new spell, Latex Underlover, that transforms its target into a vibrating latex thong.  Region specific, so good luck finding it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added three new locations for the Smelly Sorceress Tavern area.
    </li>
    <li>The link for inventory on the main game page gives you the number of items you are carrying that are NOT being worn as well as your maximum inventory item count (currently 6, but wearing certain items like purses will increase it in the future).  Hopefully now it's a bit less confusing when it comes to inventory space.</li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 2, 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        You now deal more damage against an opponent's willpower the higher level you are.  This is to try and allow higher level players to attack each other more effectively.  The extra damge is capped by the lowest level of the combatants, meaning that while a lvl 7 can do much more damage against another lvl 7, the amount of willpower damage to a level 1 will not change any.  The Weaken spell scales a bit stronger than transforming spells.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>April 1, 2014</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Added a new spell, Stiletto Stinger, that turns your opponent in a pair of black stilettos.  Region-specific, so good luck finding it!
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>March 31, 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Added three new item graphics and one character portrait from the wonderful  <a href="http://nymic-tf.deviantart.com/">Nymic-TF</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Saving a contribution and clicking the "Submit new Content" button will now automatically load the last contribution you were working on (unless the cookie that stores this expires).  Fixed a bug that kept longer submissions form being saved.  (I still recommend saving text to notepad or something just in case a server error happens to not save it.)
    </li>
    <li>
        You should now see in your attacking result message when your opponent is able to dodge your spell.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a new spell / item, Tubularly Titillating Top.  This transforms the target into a new shirt-type item.  Not region-specific yet.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can't equip two of the exact same type of acessory anymore.
    </li>
    <li>
        The largest possible discount you can get from items worn is now .9 action points.  That means even with extremely-high level gear moving will always cost a minimum of .1 action points.
    </li>
    <li>
        Character logging is implemented.  That means I know when one IP address is creating multiple characters and swapping between them to move and attack together.  To reiterate:  multiple characters is fine for the alpha, but please do not have them work together.  Stick to different places in town.
    </li>
    <li>
        Last minute update:  Implemented a cap of 2 animate characters per IP address.  This might change in the future.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>March 30, 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Added a link at the top of the page where you can directly submit new spells / forms / characters rather than having to message it through Deviant Art or elsewhere.  You can now have multiple contributions in progress at the same time; to switch between them click on the links at the top of the page that list your contributions-in-progress.
    </li>
    <li>
        Not really an update but a notice:  <b>I will be resetting the world soon.</b>  My goal is to implement some offline protection and in order to see how it works out I need everyone to start back on a level playing field.  Unlike last time the accounts with which you log in will not be deleted, only the characters and items in the game world.  I'm also planning on opening up this alpha so that anyone who wants to register can do so rather than keep it closed and by request only.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>March 29, 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>It is now harder to find willpower/mana restoring items.</li>
</ul>

<hr />


<p>March 27, 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Added a new spell, 99 Red Balloons.  You'll have to discover where to find it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Items now have levels.  They become the same level as the person who turned into them.  At the moment each level increases each effect of the item being worn by %20, though this value will probably be tweaked a good bit.  You can see the level of each item by looking at the number in the top-left of the portrait (the item type icon is now on the top-right.)
    </li>
    <li>The links for meditating, cleansing, searching, and attacking will now be disabled if you have too low action points to do them.  Additionally, the attacking links will be disabled if you've already head your attacking cap per update.</li>
    <li>
        There is now a new item bonus type:  Extra transformation energy percent on a spell cast.  This means that a player who is hit by a spell that has transformation energy will receive a bit more.  I'll probably create a similar bonus for willpower.
    </li>
    <li>
        Just as a warning, I'm working on an offline protection system.  When this is done, I'll be resetting the world so that everyone is back to square zero.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>March 24, 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Three new graphics contributed by the amazing <a href="http://nymic-tf.deviantart.com/">Nymic-TF.</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Made a few more visual changes.  When hovering the mouse over a character portrait you will see the character's description.  Hovering over other players' willpower and mana bars in the same location as you will show the exact amounts of their willpower and maximum willpower.  There are now graphical bars for action points and experience.  You can see the exact XP numbers when hovering over the XP bar.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a new spell, Leopard Love, that transforms your opponent into a leapord-spot bra.  This is the first "undershirt" item type introduced to the game.  Happy hunting!
    </li>
    <li>Added some more locations to the north, several more street locations and one new region, The Stinky Sorceress Tavern.</li>
    <li>Several more of my (Judoo's) spells are region-specific now.  I'll leave you all to figure out what is learned where.</li>
    <li>Added tooltips to the spell attack links.  They will tell you the spell's description.</li>
    <li>The level difference between you and your target has a %50 greater effect on your XP gain from attacking them.  This means higher level players will earn less XP for attacking players below them while lower level players gain more XP from attacking players above them.  This is to try and encourage higher level players to attack one another rather than recent spawns.</li>
    <li>The Impossibly Big Breasted Lady now loses an extra .75 action points when moving instead of 1, making the moving penalty a little lighter.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>March 23, 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Certain spells can only be learned in certain regions now.  For example, the "Loyal Hip Hugger" spell that turns a player into a pair of blue jeans can only be learned in Ophelia's Embroidery (at any of the 4 locations in it.)  When searching in a region that has one or more region-specific spells, you will discover (and possibly re-discover) those spells first.  Once you know them all, you are then able to discover region non-specific spells again.
    <li>
        You can now also write a short description on what happens when a player learns a spell.  For example, when a player discovers "Bunnyfootsie" by searching in  Sunnyglade Park, they will see a short message on how they came about this:  <i>As you walk around the peaceful Sunnyglade Park, a couple of fuzzy young rabbits jolt out of some bushes.  Startled and worried you might be under attack, you cast a spell that misses horribly.  The rabbits ignore you as they leap around, chasing one another in a instinctive mating ritual.  One almost crashes into your leg and you hop up, afraid of crushing the other.  You avoid harming both innocent creatures, but it gets you to thinking about what a fuzzy bunny might feel like around your feet...</i>  This description is optional.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you find something when searching and you are carrying the maximum number of items already (6), you will drop an unequipped item that you were carrying.  As a reminder, items that are worn/equipped are <b>not</b> counted as being carried.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can only attack other players three times in an update.  However, the maximum number of action points you can store has risen from 24 to 30.  This is meant to keep players from being transformed as quickly when they are offline.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed (I think!) a bug where the transformation message would not show the completed transformation text even if the target became fully transformed.
    </li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>March 22, 2014</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Did some more bug-fixing revolving around the wrong transformation messages being displayed (again).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>For anyone interested in contributing spells/forms:</b>  You can now specify a male and female version of each step of the transformation.  Meaning that if your target is male, you can provide a different %20 transformation description than if they were female, so instead of using a gender-neutral "they" and "your target" all the time you can use the proper gender pronoun, he/she/his/her etc., as you please.  This gender distinction is <b>optional</b>, and if you wish you can still use the old gender-netural version if you want.
    </li>
    <li>New spell and animate form, Bunny Love, contributed by the talented author and artist <a href="http://nymic-tf.deviantart.com/">nymic-tf</a>  This spell turns its target into a bunny girl and is the first to use the male/female transformation message system described above.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>March 20, 2014</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Fixed a bug where the displayed percentage for an animate transformation was showing the wrong amount.
    </li>
    <li>Item graphics should now appear on the "look at player" page.</li>
    <li>
        Added a new spell, Silver Sipper, which transforms its target into a silver metal flask.
    </li>
    <li>
        Introduced new type of item, reuseable consumeables.  They are used like consumeables but do not vanish from your inventory after being used.  Instead they are reuseable, able to be used after a countdown that goes down by one every time the world updates.  The Silver Sipper spell creates an an item of this type.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a new area to the map, Ophelia's Embroideries to the south.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>March 19, 2014</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        New spell, Bigger Bust or Bust, an animate transformation.  The form that results from this spell takes twice as many action points to move but will slowly regenerate willpower over time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added some new styles on main page to better show when you have unread messages.  I applied the same concept to the message list page so unread messages are highlighted.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed bug where you could get negative action points if you tried moving with a movement penalty (introduced by the Bigger or Bust spell mentiond above).  I suspect I will also need to do the same for Cleanse and Meditate.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cleansing will now remove 2% of each type of transformation energy on your character per cast.  This means you'll never be able to fully get rid of it, but at least you can drop it down a bit.
    </li>
    <li>
        Whenever you cleanse or meditate, you gain an additional willpower or mana for each level you are.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a graphic for the inanimate "game over" page that shows the item portrait of what you have been turned into.
    </li>
    <li>
        Restyled your character's information that appears at the top of the page.  Still a work in progress.
    </li>


</ul>

<hr />

<p>March 18, 2014</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        New spell, Latex Legs, submitted by the amazing jBovinne!
    </li>
    <li>
        You can now send messages to other players in the game!
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>
    March 17, 2014
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        You can now only carry 6 items at a time.  This number does <b>not</b> include clothes/accessories that you are currently wearing.  This is aimed at stopping players from hoarding too many willpower/mana restorers.  For now this only applies to picking up new items; searching and finding an item or taking an equipped item might allow you to carry more.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added some icons that appear at the top-left of item portraits that indicate what item type they are--hat, shirt, undershirt, pants, underpants, shoes, accessory, or consumeable.
    </li>
    <li>
        The amount of experience gained from casting a spell on another player is no longer based on how much transformation energy the spell attacks with.  Instead, it gives a base of 5 points.  If your spell is transforming your target into an animate form, you gain a %50 XP bonus.  The amount of experience points you receive is also based on the level of your victim; there is a 1 xp penalty per level when casting against a lower level opponent and a 1xp bonus per level when casting against a higher level opponent.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed an issue with the random name suggestion script when starting out a new character.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a new spell, form, and item:  "Dressmaker" submitted by JBovinne!  Much thanks!
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>March 16, 2014</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Everyone's account has been deleted.  Feel free to register your own account this time rather than using the Alpha_# accounts I messaged you (the alpha testers) about.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Added experience points and levels.  Leveling up raises your maximum willpower and mana.  Each level is harder to obtain than the previous in typical RPG fashion.  Spells do not have level requirements <b>yet</b>--I'm planning on implementing this in the future.
    </li>
    <li>
        Forms can now have bonus and penalties.  For example, being turned into a busty blonde bimbo currently lowers your maximum willpower and mana by 20.  If you are transformed into a different animate form, the bonuses/penalties from the last will be removed.
    </li>
    <li>
        When casting a spell against another player, the percent transformed does not strictly refer to whether or your opponent's transformation energy but shows the lower of percent transformation by transformation energy OR health.  For example, casting an inanimate spell against another player when they have %100 transformation energy required but still has %55 willpower left will print out %45 transformed instead of %100.
    </li>
    <li>
        Character portraits in the "Players here" part of the main game page now have two sub-icons, one at the top left that shows their current level and another at the top right that shows their gender.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are some new locations to explore, the gas station car wash to the south and Sunnyglade Park to the Northeast.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rather than seeing the time that something happened in a strange, ugly format, each log message will show hours/minutes ago instead.
    </li>
    <li>
        Searching now costs 4 action points onstead of 2, but the chances of finding something are  greater.
    </li>
    <li>
        Meditating now takes 4 action points instead of 2 but restores 10 base mana instead of 5.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cleansing now takes 4 action points instead of 2 but restores 10 base willpower instead of 5.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added 1 new spell and item, Loyal Tight Blue Jeans.
    </li>

</ul>

<hr />

<p>March 14, 2014</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Added graphics for pink bunny slippers, statuette, and plain pink panties, generously contributed by tf-nymic.
    </li>
    <li>Created game news / updates / contributors page (you're reading it now.)</li>

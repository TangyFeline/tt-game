    <h1>Updates, News, and Announcements</h1>
    <h4>We will be posting game updates, news, and a list of <a href="#contributorsTable">community contributors</a> here.</h4>

    <p>May 6-7</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Here are the plans for Alpha round 20:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bad">IN PROGRESS:  </span>Update all contributions to use new stats system.</li>
            <li><span class="bad">UNSTARTED:  </span>Update all EFFECT contributions to use new stats system.</li>
            <li><span class="bad">UNSTARTED:  </span>Make all new levelup perks using new stats system.</li>
            <li><span class="bad">UNSTARTED:  </span>Allow friends to set nicknames for each other on the Friends page listing meant to better keep track of who is who inbetween characters and rounds.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>All items, not just consumables, are now locked into game modes.  This means that a player turned into an item by a PvP mode player can only be picked up or worn by another player in PvP mode, and similarly a player turned by a Protection or SuperProtection player can only be worn by Protection and SuperProtection players.  Players who are taken out by any bots or are automatically collected off of the ground and send to Lindella or Wuffie will be set to a Neutral game mode; as soon as they are worn by a player they will inherit that game mode.  Right now all existing items have been set to neutral mode.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>You can now assign nicknames to active friends on your Friends list.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Jewdewfae will still move around randomly, but she will visit each location only once per cycle.  Once she has been to all of them, she will be able to go anywhere again.</li>
</ul>
    </ul>

        <li>Alpha Round 19 has ended!  Congratulations to Lex Fairchild for having the most dungeon points.  The game will now enter chaos mode likely for a week or so, depending on how fast stats can be reapplied to forms / items / pets.</li>
        <li><span class="tldr">TO ALL CONTRIBUTORS:</span>  Transformania Time is undergoing a conversion on how stats are applied to animate forms, items, and pets.  If you are an author, please update your contributions according to the new balancing rules.  The proofreaders and I will also work on this conversion.  The new balancing rules are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>ANIMATE FORMS:  You must balance 0 points in the various new categories, including up to -10 negative stats for an absolute total of 20.</li>
            <li>ITEMS:  You must balance to 10 points in the various new categories, including up to -5 negative stats for an absolute total of 15.</li>
            <li>PETS:  You must balance to 20 points in the various new categories, including up to -8 negative stats for an absolute total of 28.</li>
            <li>All transformation-based (ie, not curses) spells should cost 7 mana to cast.</li>
            <li>All spells should deal 4.5 WP damage.</li>
            <li>All spells should add 10 TF Energy points per cast.</li>
            <li>All spells should require 70 TF Energy points in order to be transformed.</li>
            <li><i>The inputs for the 4 fields above on the Contribution have been made readonly so not to confused new authors.  You can make them editable again by clicking a link at the bottom of the page.</i></li>
            <li><b>Please remove any of the old stats on the contribution once the new ones are in place.</b>  (The only exception to this is movement discount; you can keep this at -999 for immobile forms.)</li>
            <li>When you have updated your form, <span class="tldr">Please mark the contribution as needing to be republished.</span></li>

        <li><span class="tldr">Patreon has replied to my support ticket and will be kicking off April's missed collection soon.</span>  This means that payment this month will be slightly delayed but should process as usual.  Thanks for your patience and support!</li>

    <p>May 4</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="tldr">TO ALL PATREON SUPPORTERS:</span>  It appears that because of an issue where Patreon reset my account settings a month ago, the collection option was changed from a monthly charge to a per-creation charge (a model where all supporters are charge new some new content is released rather than on a reocurring basis.)  I am waiting to see if Patreon will still be able to kick off the collection for last month.  Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your support!</li>
        <li>In case you are wondering about other news, the stats rehaul is underway.  Contributors and proofreaders should be able to convert existing forms / items / pets / curses to the new system once chaos mode begins and I deploy the changes on the test server to the live one.</li>

    <p>April 12-13</p>

    <ul>
        <li>There will likely be few to no updates to the game during this upcoming round as combat mechanics and item / form stats are taken an extensive look at.  (Please contribute to the ongoing discussion here: <a href="http://luxianne.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=704">http://luxianne.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=704</a>. )</li>
        <li>Here are the plans for Alpha round 19:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Disable PvP-P mode switching.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Decrease spawn rate and amount of dungeon artifacts significantly.  Force the dungeon to change more frequently.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>The amount of TF energy buildup should now be displayed on attack text.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Players will take some increased WP damage if they have too much TF energy on them (125%+ of TF energy required for a given transformation and scaling up further at 150%.)  This is a temporary measure.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Rerolling players now have the option of keeping their old name.  If their name is a match to an existing account of theirs, it will be given a roman numeral as part of the last name to indicate the "generation" of the player.  This only works up to 10 generations.  Make sure to reserve your name if you have not done so already.</li>

        <li><span class="tldr">Alpha Round 18 is scheduled to begin tomorrow, March 23 at 10:00pm UTC.</span></li>
        <li>Alpha Round 17 has ended!  Thank you all for your patience while I have been working on the new PvP dungeon mechanics.  The game has now entered chaos mode for a few days while we prepare for round 18's start with the launch of the dungeon.  The dungeon is now PvP exclusive.</li>
        <li>Here are the plans for Alpha round 18 relating to the new PvP dungeon:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Custom spell, Vanquish, used against the dungeon demons.  This can only be cast against demons, and only Vanquish and Weaken can be used against them.  You should learn this spell immediately upon entering the dungeon for the first time.  (If you are in the dungeon already you'll have to leave and re-enter to learn it.)</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>You may now only enter the dungeon from two locations, the intersections Street: Main Street and Sunnyglade Drive Intersection and Street: Main Street and E. 9th Avenue Intersection.  You must now also be in PvP mode for this and it will take 30 action points to deter spamming.  You can leave the dungeon from anywhere but must not have been in combat in the past half hour.  Entering and exiting the dungeon will return you to a random location.</li>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>Statistics to record artifacts found, dungeon demons defeated, movements made in the dungeon, and dungeon points stolen from other players.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Other plans:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>You should be able to stay online a bit longer before being logged out (however there still is usually once or twice a day when the memory is flushed and everyone gets logged off.)</li>

            <li><span class="good">COMPLETE:  </span>AP Movement discount should now be clamped at .66 instead of .9 .</li>
        </ul>

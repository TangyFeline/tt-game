<p>You can purchase clothing and items that were once fellow mages like you from Lindella, as well as a variety of non-human magical consumable items that will help you from ending up in a similar fate from your enemies.  Please keep in mind that some of Lindella's formerly-human merchandise may not be fond of their new inanimate lifestyle or their owners and change back after struggling against the magic trapping them long enough.  No refunds!</p>

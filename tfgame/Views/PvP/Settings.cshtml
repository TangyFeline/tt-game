            You can reserve your name so that no other players take it at the start of a new round and steal your identity.

        <h2>RP Mode</h2>

    <p>
        If you choose to enter RP mode, you are publicly indicated to other players that you enjoy roleplaying.
        You can enable and disable this at any time you want.  Click on the link below to enter RP mode.<br /><br />

        <h2>Protection Mode</h2>

    <p>
        Protection Mode is meant for players who want a more casual or role-playing game experience.  It prevents other human players from being able to be attacked by, or attacking with, inanimate or animal spells unless they are your friend.  There is a delay between when you can enter and leave protection equal to 12 turns times your level, and a player must be online while the game updates in order for the turn count to decrement.<br /><br />

The narrative continues below.</i><br><br>

"So how long have you been a tree?  I bet 'yer real eager to get out and stretch 'yer legs a bit, arentcha?" The winged girl asked.  Of course I could not speak as I had no mouth.  Even if I did my mind was still straining to summon up some remembrance of spoken language.  "Well, let me see what I can do!" She giggled, flying rings about my trunk, searching for some feature or flaw of my bark-imprisoned body in which to free me from my curse.<br><br>

Some hours passed this way, the winged girl poking at my fur, peeling away small strips of bark, sampling my roots and leaves, chewing on them thoughtfully as though my herbal essence might reveal to her some new bounty of insight.  As the evening crept into night she slept in a nest with a family of young chicks, changing into a bird and squawking alongside the others to be fed by the mother.  As hours turn into days I grew doubtful of her abilities and her interest by this time, I must confess.  But she persisted, taking shade underneath my canopy of leaves when the sun struck down from its highest and finding refuge in the nest of my hollow when night fell.<br><br>

"My sisters really got you good," she sighed on the morning of the seventh day.  "I don't know if I can crack their magic here, it's pretty strong.  You musta' eaten some food sprinkled with Dalila's Ruin.  Nasty nasty plant, very rare.  Doesn't grow on this side of the ocean at all.   I'm really running out of ideas here, Biggie.  Except for one but I don't think 'yer gonna like it..."<br><br>
 
The fae sat down on my sturdiest branch and began to chant some incantation in a language I did not recognize, an old and forgotten tongue, or perhaps one mankind has never been privileged to learn.  Yet as her song went on I could began to understand a word here and there, a phrase.. An expression, a raw emotion!  I could understand!  Her song was of the inferno of the sun, the tears of the sea, the fading of mountains by eons of wind and rain!  A song of the timeless monsters of the deep and the isolation of a sun-whitened skull stranded forgotten in a vast desert.  A song of the cycle of predator and prey, of hawks and hares, mice and owls, wolves and deer, the endless cycle of life and death and rebirth.  As the song became familiar to me II too could feel the words on my tongue and so I sang alongside the fae from the fathoms of my lonely heart.<br><br>

I sang!  I had a voice again!  My voice, pure and sweet, blended with the lyrics of Jewdewfae.  How could this be?  I at long last had found some measure of freedom from my existence as a tree, yet my voice was not my own.  As this eeriness dawned on me I shrieked, at once shattering the spell of the song.  At once I felt my body suffocating of crampedness.  I felt constricted, crushed, wedged in a hollow far too small!  I needed to escape!<br><br>

"Shhh, calm down ya Biggie!" Jewdewfae laughed at me.  In a blink she was a tiny winged girl no more but a full grown woman of human size and stature, seizing my shoulder and heaving me out of the wooden hollow which encased the majority of my body.  I was human once more, crawling out of my tree-body through a hollow like a newborn from the womb.  I would soon learn just how newborn I truly was as I fell to the ground, muscles weak as if I had never used them before.  I lay there, naked, face down in the dirt.  How strange to have a face again after so many years of possessing none, for my vision to be restricted to straight in front of me instead of from every direction at once as I could as a tree!  How strange to once more breath with relaxing and contracting lungs instead of the slow calm sip of air through my leaves!  How small and fragile I felt now, a fleshy biped scrabbling about in the dirt to feed his belly just to live another day!  A panic nearly overtook me, a desire to crawl back within my comforting prison and resume my peaceful slumber anchored firmly in the ground!<br><br>

"'Yer not gonna just lay on the ground all day, are ya?" Jewdewfae teased.  I felt her arms wrap underneath my shoulders, lifting my weak body to my feet, turning me around to face her, my fae savior!  "Easy now!  So what's 'yer name, Biggie?"<br><br>

I fought to remember how to move my lips to reply.  "Matthias," I told the fae-woman.  But my voice was not any I had ever heard before, certainly not my own!  I gasped and threw my hands up to clutch at my throat, but my hands were stopped by a most unfamiliar protrusion--breasts!  Supple, soft, firm womanly breasts right on my my own chest!<br><br>

Energized by my wonder and panic I rushed to the stream to catch a glimpse of my reflection in the trickling water.  I fell to my knees and gazed upon the form of a slender woman who moved as I did, her heavy, milky pale breasts heaving up and down with my own deep gasps!  I was her and she was me!  No longer was I Matthias the adventurer and explorer, nor even a man... who was I?  What had I become?<br><br>

“What, you never seen a lady before?” Jewdewfae laughed, embracing me from behind as I crouched in the mud, still in the form of a full grown woman wearing a frayed blue dress.  Her touch calmed me; it had been many years since I'd known the touch of a woman, let alone a fellow being of flesh and blood!  Exhausted, I fell back into her arms and lay down with my head upon her lap.  I gazed down my new form past my breasts to my hips, legs, and feet.  A woman I was; a gentle touch between my legs confirmed that not a trace of manhood remained upon my body, replaced instead with the folds of a woman.<br><br>

Jewdewfae sang me a lullaby as I lost consciousness and drifted into sleep.  The follow morning I would learn of my fate.<br><br>

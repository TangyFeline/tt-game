<i>Editor’s note:  Several pages are lost from the narrative here.  While Sunnyglade scholars and historians have some competing theories as of the events that transpired in this period of time, readers should assume nothing beyond what Mabel herself wrote.  The narrative continues below.</i><br><br>

<b>Date and year unknown</b>.  What can I write?  Who could possibly believe me should anyone ever read this journal again?  The pages are soaked; the ink has blotted together, obscuring my thoughts as I had written so many months back.  Even my memory is as indistinct as the splashes of darkness that seep through the paper like a wound that soaks through all its bandages…  What little I have been able to save has only been through the greatest help of the young fairy, my tiny little savior… <br><br>

I shall recount the events of the past few years--decades perhaps?--the best I can.  Late in spring--May, as the Fae has helped me to revive from the soggy remnants of my journal--was when I joined with nature, with the rocks and trees around me, my roots sipping at the steady trickle of the lake through the years.  The magic of the original inhabitants of the forest--dangerous and mischievous fairies as I would later learn, tricking me with the feast they had laid out for me--had changed my body into that of a young tree fighting to grow tall and steal as great a share of the sun as possible underneath the canopy of elder trees and branches.<br><br>

How could any human soul understand that which I felt and endured?  As the magic of the forest’s inhabitants passed through my body from that tainted dinner, my skin had changed to bark, my arms raised, locked in place, reaching up to grasp at the light of the sun.  How could any mortal comprehend the sweetness of sap as it slowly flows through one’s veins, giving life to the leaves at the extremities of a multitude of arms, then feeling the pinch and crinkle as autumn steals them away, the weight of snow and ice crushing down the skeleton branches all winter long?  The tickle of tiny birds’ feet scratching along the skin, the ceaseless chatter and warmth of a family of squirrels nesting in a snug little hollow?  How to describe the ecstatic shiver as bees circle around and sip at one’s blossoms in springtime?  The long groan of a squelching summer drought and the relief of a heavy rain, the crash of thunder and lightning striking at you and your neighbors yet immobilized and powerless to evade it?  The swaying of our arms as great winds threaten to tear you apart and topple you?  The itching left from the wounds as bucks grind their antlers against your trunk, the humiliation of a wild alpha wolf marking you as his territorial boundary?  All this I saw and felt and more, unable to move or speak, watching as the rains soaked through the leather binding of my journal and wash out the last reminder of my former humanity.<br><br>

How then did my old life not rot away with the muddy pages of my journal, to become nothing more and nothing less than another tree in a great untamed forest?  It was through no volition of my own.  I had long resigned myself to the earth when the fairy came to me.  I can recall the morning when she found me better as a lone incident than any others over the span of the years.  I was standing still, as only a tree can, when a young winged woman just nine inches tall fluttered to me and landed on the branch that had long ago been my left arm.  At first I took no special notice or care, mistaking her for a bluebird stopping by as thousands had done in mornings past.  But then she spoke.  I had not heard uttered language in such a long time!  My attention perked and I wondered if I had been dreaming.<br><br>

“You feel funny,” she said, squirming against a smooth patch of the branch where the bark had fallen away..  “You some kinda funny tree or somethin’?”<br><br>

I trembled, a faint vibration mimicking the disturbance of a gentle breeze--all the movement I could muster, and even this simple gesture drained me of much strength and willpower.<br><br>

“You ARE funny!” she giggled, jumping to her tiny, mudcaked feet.  “You’re not a tree at all, are you?  What are you, a nymph?  A shy little goddess?  A really bad witch?”  With this she lifted herself up into the air with her translucent blue wings, zipping around my trunk like a fly seeking honey.  As she circled by me I caught glimpses of pale blue tattoos across her arms and face, a tattered sky blue dress scarcely clinging to her petite womanly body.  She traced a tiny finger around my skin and through my leaves, her touch warm in a way I had not felt in eons… the warmth of flesh against my own!<br><br>

“No, you’re not any of those, are ya?  You’re not playing a prank on me, are you, sis Dela-Dru-Onomoaon?  Nah, couldn’t be…”  She came to rest, clinging on to the bump that once had been my nose like a moth.  “You’re… I know!  I know!  You’re a Biggie!  You’re a silly dumb cute human!  Oh boy… my sisters got to you, didn’t they?  They don’t much like it when you 
biggies tromp through these woods.  I probably shouldn’t be talking with you at all right now.  But this forest is just so… so… boring!  Tell you what, let’s make a deal.  If I free you, do promise to play with me for like, forever?  My name’s Jewdewfae.  I’d shake your hand, but, you know…  You’re a tree!  And you don’t have any hands!  Because you’re a tree!”<br><br>

My heart--metaphorically of course, as whatever human organs I possessed before must not have been present in my current state--leapt.  Could she do such a thing?  Restore me back into a man?  And if she could, had I already lost too much of my humanity to survive it?  Or had it been too long, my fate sealed as a silently wooden inhabitant of these strange and uncharted lands?<br><br>

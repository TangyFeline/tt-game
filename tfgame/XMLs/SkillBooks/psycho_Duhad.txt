<b>Day 1</b>
 <p>Dear diary, hello! I know that you are nothing, but a cheap collection of papers, but I hope that if I don’t make it, you will tell my story to the world. And if I DO make it, that my future publicist is reading this right now as part of a massive book deal I am being offered. Either way, thank you for taking the time to read my story.</p>
 <p>As of time of writing, it’s been a few days since everything went to hell… I don’t know if it was the magic that set it all in motion or if that just exacerbated things. Either way, the town is in shambles and just about the only people still left here are the crazy magical SOB’s that keep blasting survivors into… well mostly women’s clothing. If this is the end of days, then just about every religious book that I have ever read was WAY off!</p>
 <p>Anyway, thinking about it, there is very little I really want to talk about right now diary, so I will leave you here for tonight.</p>

<b>Day 2</b>
 <p>The sneaky psychopathic bitch! Diary, it is only through luck and my own amazing skill that I am able to recount what happened to me today, and that was because today was very nearly the last day of my life as a human being!</p>
 <p>I had been walking back from… borrowing supplies from the Old Oak Apartments when I saw a young woman in the street, clearly in some distress. As I came closer, I saw she was holding what looked like a dog’s collar in one hand and was frantically searching for something. Obviously now I realize what a bad idea what I did next was, but at the time… I thought she was just a poor lost soul in need of help.</p>
 <p>I approached her, tried to offer her help, but when she turned around and saw me, it was like she was both looking at me and looking straight through me at the same time. She started ranting about her dog and started beckoning to me and ordering me to “Come back to momma.” It took me a second to realize she was also casting a spell on me, but when I felt a tail starting to push against my pants I nearly jumped out of my skin! Luckily, it seems my magic was stronger than hers and even with her surprise attack; it was hardly a fair fight as I transformed her into a rather frilly bra.</p>
 <p>I considered taking her with me, these crazies lack the mental discipline to free themselves once transformed, but was far too unnerved by the idea of having a sentient item staring at me while I slept. Still, the rush of power I felt when she finally was locked into her new form was… exhilarating… I can’t help, but wonder how it would feel to do it again…</p>

<b>Day 3</b>
 <p>Diary, as I am sure you remember, yesterday I was attacked by one of this town’s plethora of crazed magical nut cases. That experience was frightening, but it also made me curious about these poor people driven mad by the very magical gift that has set them above normal people. This curiosity has led me to observe them and relay my findings to you.</p>
 <p>First of all, as I suspected from my own encounter with them, they are anti-social to an extreme. Even the slightest hint of aggression toward them, from a straight out attack to simply catching their eye seems to set them off and once angered, they will chase there aggravator all the way across the town till they have either vented their rage or been forcibly dealt with. While some more stable minded people I have observed have avoided this by keeping their eyes down at all times, when two Psychopaths cross paths when not otherwise distracted, a fight is inevitable, and since neither will back down, it is inevitably a fight to the… well not death, but close enough.</p>
 <p>Finally while their magical abilities are often impressive, their deranged mental states seem to leave them with only enough presence of mind to cast a single spell, over and over without deviation or thought to tactics. Interestingly, this limitation seems to be part of their affliction as even after finishing a fight, they will simply continue with the same spell on their next target… I do not know if this is due to some obsessive compulsive quirk, a limit to their abilities brought on by the damage to their minds or if they simply do not even realize that there various targets are different people.</p>
 <p>Whatever the reason, they are clearly too far gone to be helped and far too dangerous to treat as anything less than wild animals.</p>

<b>Day 4</b>
 <p>Diary I write in you today more shaken than I have ever been in my whole life! I don’t know if there is something wrong with me or if the time I have spent in this town is just hardening me to common decency. Whatever the reason, I think I might have crossed a line I might not be able to come back from.</p>
 <p>You see, I was out making observations on the town’s inhabitants and collecting what supplies I could when I saw a man approaching me from down the street. Knowing what an encounter with another person in this town often means, I lashed out, striking at them with the same frilly bra spell which worked so well before. They responded and before long we were caught in an all-out battle, which might explain why I did not notice at the time that he was trying different tactics, utilizing things he carried on his person and even seemed to react with appropriate fear when I began to take the upper hand.</p>
 <p>But while I can forgive myself for ignoring that, I cannot just forget what happened next…</p>
 <p>I was close to finishing him, when he turned and fled, doing something that no psychopath I have ever observed ever do! And, flushed with adrenalin and blinded by my own desire, no NEED to win I ran him down like a dog. By the time he collapsed from exhaustion in the ballroom of the long abandoned mansion, I was too far gone to stop myself from finishing the spell, even as he feebly begged for me to spare him.</p>
 <p>It was almost a full minute afterwards that I realized what I had done and dropped my prize on the dusty floor, fleeing the scene of my heinous crime.</p>

<b>Day 6</b>
 <p>Dear diary, I have spent the last two days in hiding, trying to understand what drove me to do what I did to that other mage. In that time I mulled over the events of the fight, the other spell casters methods and my own motivations and it has all led me to one inevitable conclusion…</p>
 <p>If he had been stronger, he would still be here.</p>
 <p>All of us still here in Sunnyglade are blessed with magical powers beyond mortal understanding and yet so many of them squander this gift! They run around like insects, picking through the trash, looking for things to help them stave off their inevitable fall to the stronger magic users. And like insects, when they cross paths with their betters, they are crushed.</p>
 <p>My defeating that man was no more ‘wrong’ than if I had slapped a mosquito whose bite had annoyed me. I have let my misplace guilt slow me down, but tomorrow I hit the streets and hone my skills, till I no longer need to fear being crushed under the feet of someone more powerful than myself.</p>

<b>Day 8</b>
 <p>HELP ME! IF ANYONE FINDS THIS, A LOATHFUL PSYCHOPATH IS TRYING TO TURN ME INTO A BR</p>

 <p>Dear diary, I am sorry that you have been spoiled by my RUDE pray. You will be happy to know that even though they scribbled baseless slander all over you in pen that they will never have a chance to do that again to anyone else’s private property.</p>
 <p>Honestly, I used to think that the psychopaths of this town were the real problem, but since I have started to patrol the streets, improving my skills and cleaning this town of the filth that infests it, I have learned that the so called ‘sane’ towns people are just as bad! While some show their respect by averting their eyes as they pass me, others flagrantly show there disrespect and then have the gall to run when I try to punish them for their insolence!</p>
 <p>It hardly matters though, none of them can escape me and none of them can challenge me.</p>
 <p>As for you, dear diary, I think our time together is coming to an end. You have done your job of chronicling my rise and revelations admirably and now it is time for you to share what I have learned with the world. I will leave you with the proprietor of Words of Wisdom and they will see that you are read by anyone with enough sense to recognize the value of my wisdom.</p>

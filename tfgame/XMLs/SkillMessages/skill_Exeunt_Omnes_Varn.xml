<DiscoveryMessage>Sitting atop the manager's desk is a rather large hardback book, bound in strange look leather, it's cover inscribed with numerous sigils, runes, and pentagrams.  With trepidation, you open the book, examining the table of contents - only to find it is a collection of many other works of dubious character.  The Key of Solomon ...  The Malleus Malefiacarum ...  Practical Transformations and the Metaphysical Realm ...  The Liber Paginarum Fulvarum ... The King in Yellow ... De Vermis Mysteriis ... The Twilight Saga ... The Necronomicon ... every one of which essentially a how-to guide on how to unleash untold horrors upon this plane of existence.  Shuddering, you try to tear yourself away, close the book before anything can happen - and for the most part you are successful.  But the words of one of the incantations you saw remain; you can still see the individual letters when you close your eyes, lit up as if by hellfire in your internal vision, asking, no - DEMANDING - that you recite them.  Do you dare?</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>"Exeunt omnes!" - read the incantation you glimpsed in the collected spellbooks - "Exeunt omnes spiritae corpus!  Possidete est formae de semimarem duodecim daemonum!"  The letters of the spell seem to blaze within your mind, urging you to speak them ... though given their source, doing so may be quite dangerous.</Description>

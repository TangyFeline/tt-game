<DiscoveryMessage>You notice something interesting written on the wall, and walk over to get a better look. No matter how much you squint your eyes you can't make out what it says. If only you had some glasses . . . wait a minute, why don't you just MAKE some glasses? </DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>Some people have mediocre eyesight and use glasses to enhance their vision. Other people are just turned on by glasses! No matter the need, this spell transforms its target into a pair of Cat Eye Glasses.</Description>

<DiscoveryMessage>After a bit of looking around the bookstore, you come upon the textbook section. All manner of books for different courses are laid out in front of you, but it's the Sexual Education course that catches your eye. After a brief read-through you come upon a new spell... Congratulations, you have learned the Studious Sucker spell! </DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>Everyone deserves a higher education and now you can help your fellow spell-casters obtain it - whether they want it or not. This spell will turn your target into a voluptuous red-haired schoolgirl, eager to get her grades (and other things) up. Though, she may not be very good at studying there are other ways of "sucking up" to her professors...</Description>

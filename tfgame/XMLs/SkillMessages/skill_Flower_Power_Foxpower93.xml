<DiscoveryMessage>Wandering around, you spot a rose bush planted inside a large pot. The beautiful flowers seem to be in full bloom and you realize they must be the source of the powerful yet pleasant aroma that is invading the surrounding air. For a brief moment, you take in the scent and allow it to calm you and soothe your worries away. You could get used to this! Unfortunately, a glance at the pot tells you it would be impossible to move it, though an idea does strike you... if you can't move the flowers, maybe you could make the flowers able to move!</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>Flowers are lovely things known for their good looks, pleasant scents, and some of them even have medicinal value. Now that you know how to make a flower, why not liven up this dreary city with a few of them?</Description>

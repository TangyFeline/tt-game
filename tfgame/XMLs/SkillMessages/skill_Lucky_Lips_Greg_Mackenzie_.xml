<DiscoveryMessage>Whilst walking outside a make-up shop, a page from what looks like an old make-up catalogue lands on your foot. Picking it up you see it in fact describes a spell to turn someone into a tube of ruby red lipstick, capable of seducing even the most hardy of wizards.</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>Once this spell has been cast, your opponent will become a tube of lipstick that, once used, will give anyone a very seductive charm!</Description>

<DiscoveryMessage>You notice a small ball of light floating in the center of the room. Curiosity gets the best of you as you reach your fingers out and touch the small white orb. A feeling of despair washes over you as horrible sights of sobbing faces of the souls of those unwillingly changed into objects, animals, and other horrid things. Tears stain your cheeks, feeling your own body begin to change shapes into something else, something inhuman as the fear of these lost souls warps your own magic against you. Before you could be lost to the sea of fear, a bright white light shines in front of you as a stunning white horse gallops into your sight. Her silver horn casts a beam of light all around you, banishing all the fear and horrible lost souls. You open your eyes as the memories form a spell to create that beautiful creature that had saved you from the darkness.</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>The dreams of peace and kindness from the heart of a special young witch. This spell was given birth by the tears she shed from the cruelty of the spell casters in this town and how many lost their free will just for the chance at glory and power. This spell changes the one it is cast on into a female creature known for it's kindness, love, healing, and compassion.</Description>

<DiscoveryMessage>While walking along you notice suits of armor lining up either side of the room. Each of them standing on a pedestal and standing guard over those who live in this castle. However you seem to notice that these are huge and are meant to be worn by men... something in short supply in town. You grin as you make up a spell to fix that, and to actually make them useful... New spell Learned! Maiden's armor!</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>You've always thought that normal clothing wasn't that protective. Now to give those barely clothed women proper protection!</Description>

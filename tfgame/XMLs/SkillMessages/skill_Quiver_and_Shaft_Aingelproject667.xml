<DiscoveryMessage>While searching around the Sapphire Lake Campground, you hear the rustling of leaves behind you. You turn around, and find yourself looking at the tip of an arrow, pointed at you from only feet away from a small elven girl. No wait...not a girl, you realize as you look closer. The elf is male, but his feminine hairstyle, soft face, and wide, flared hips make it hard to tell. The two of you regard each other for a moment, before the femboy lowers his bow, his eyes dropping in apologetic submission at his mistaking you for an enemy before disappearing back into the woods, showing off his nice bubble butt as he does so. You watch as he runs off, then think to yourself. This world is in need of more elves... why not make a few yourself? With that, you use your skills to cook up a new spell, one that will help to add to the elven population....at the expense of other populations, of course. And, perhaps, with the new elves being a little... cuter than before.</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>It is no surprise that the population of elves in these parts has dwindled so, especially ever since you casters came around and started turning all our males into females, and then into panties, shoes, animals and other things that..aren't elves. With this spell, you can remedy that! And...make them a little cuter while you're at it. </Description>

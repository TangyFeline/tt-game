<DiscoveryMessage>Wandering into the secret laboratory of Dr. Hadkin and searching around a bit too long you come across some interesting research. It seems as though some lab rats were rather intimately combined with each other and as you peer over the notes you wonder if this might be the fact of the Doctor himself. Whatever the case the idea is born, the magic is weaved, you've got a new spell to test out...</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>Clothing is just not intimate enough for you, with this spell you can get even closer to your target, or rather your target can get even closer to you. </Description>

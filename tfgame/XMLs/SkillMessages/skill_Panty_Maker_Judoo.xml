<DiscoveryMessage>You see a bundle of panties shrink-wrapped in the clothing store.  One bag is open and you see a pair hanging out of it, almost as if it were trying to crawl away.  You can't sense any human presence in the fabric so you conclude the position is just a coincidence.  But just because this is a regular cloth pair, you get to wondering how a pair of human panties might feel...</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>Ever too lazy to run some laundry, or just need a pair of plain old panties here and now?  This spell may solve that problem.</Description>

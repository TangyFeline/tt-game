<DiscoveryMessage>You stop in front a raspberry bush and bend over, determined to pick a few of the delicious treats. Just then you hear a rustling of leaves from the bush. Expecting to be ambushed you back up fearfully, only to see a small skunk waddle out. Knowing better then to provoke him you turn and run as fast as you can. Thinking that if only they could emit the sweet scent of berries instead, they would be so much cuter. Slowly an idea forms in your mind as you head off to find someone to test it on. Whether they like it or not.

<Description>Skunks are cute, but they also stink. Luckily you may know of a way to make one without the stench. </Description>

<DiscoveryMessage>You come across an old tool shed in EGM's bar-can-strewn back yard.  It's old and boarded up--the girls don't do much of the repairs around here themselves it seems.  You step through a crack between some fallen-away boards and rummage through the shed when come across an unexpected treat, an old fashioned oil lamp, just like those in the movies and TV shows about genies and thieves. You halfheartedly rub the lamp, not expecting anything to happen, and you are not disappointed. Nothing does. However it gives you a good idea. With the proper arcane geometry and a healthy dose of magic, one could become as powerful as a Djinn... but at what cost? It might be better to practice this on others before casting it upon yourself. Itâ€™s time to Make a Wish!</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>There are few forces out there more powerful than a sorcerer.  This spell will turn your opponent into one such being, but at the price of enslaving them for eternity.</Description>

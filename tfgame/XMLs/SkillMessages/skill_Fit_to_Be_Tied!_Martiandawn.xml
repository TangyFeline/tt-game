<DiscoveryMessage>As you stroll around the beauty spa you nearly collide with a young woman who is struggling to keep her ample breasts from falling out of her top. Her blouse seems to be a couple of sizes too small (perhaps it shrank in the wash?), and to make matters worse most of the buttons have popped off. You don't know why she doesn't just tie the ends of the shirt together and be done with it.  Sayâ€¦ that gives you an idea for a spell!</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>Sometimes it can be such a bother to have to deal with buttons, especially if you need to get undressed in a hurry. It's so much simpler to tie off your top and be done with it, and when you need to strip all it takes is a quick tug and you're in business. This spell was designed to address that issue!</Description>

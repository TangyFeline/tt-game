<DiscoveryMessage>You stop for a moment to sit upon one of the bleachers, the hot sun wearing you down with its oppressive heat. A haze covers the field, draining the effort of everyone wandering across it. Despite this, the cheerleaders are still at work, high kicking their way across the field, pom poms in the air. School girls walk around in groups, giggling and occasionally turning a hapless stranger into a pair of heels. One of the group nearest you seems to be struggling, wiping her brow with one arm and plucking at her trousers with the other, clearly unwilling to reveal her legs without proper coverage, despite the heat. An idea seems to strike her, sinister smile noticeable even from this distance as she spies another wanderer. The school girl rushes towards her as quickly as her heels will carry her, the sound alerting the girl, but it is too late. The school girl grabs her around the waist, the burst of magic obscuring your view of the events. It quickly fades, revealing a smug school girl holding a pair of long white socks, similar to those used by women in gyms. They do look rather light and comfortable...</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>Are you looking for something to cover your long legs?

Now, all you need is a volunteer, ready to cling to your legs and tickle your toes, whether they like it or not.</Description>

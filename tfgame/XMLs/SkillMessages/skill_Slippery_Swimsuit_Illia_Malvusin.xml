<DiscoveryMessage>Looking at the local swimming pool, a memory of watching the SCCC Women's Swim Team practicing goes through your head. Their young, supple forms swimming through the pool, their tight swimsuits showing their curves in all the right ways... You sigh as you think about how those tight swimsuits haven't been seen around since the SCCC disbanded its swimming department â€“ before remembering that you can simply MAKE more with your magical abilities! You quickly come up with a spell to give you a nice new swimsuit, one to help your current situation...</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>This spell turns the target into a one-piece latex swimsuit, perfect for a nice dip in the local lake, a relaxing swim in the pool, or for engaging in transformative battles with your fellow mages! </Description>

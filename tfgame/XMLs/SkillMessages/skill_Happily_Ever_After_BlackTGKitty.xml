<DiscoveryMessage>As you enter the pink bedroom, you see that it was the bedroom of a young princess. You can see her tiara on the bed. You approach it and for some reason you put it on. Strange thoughts flow to your mind and without knowing it, you for some reason let out a giggle. You take the tiara off fast before anything else happen to you, but now you have the power to make others wear that tiara.</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>With this spells you can make all those happy stories you read when you were young, come true.</Description>

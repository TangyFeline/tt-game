<DiscoveryMessage>In a forgotten corner of the rooftop, you find an unusual book on astronomy. Obviously written by a madman, it says that outer space is merely a reflection of earthly shadows. It also says that those shadows are inhabited by strange creatures made of negative starlight or something. You can't really make heads or tails of his rambling. As you flip through the pages, you come across a summoning spell for one of these creatures that says it can bind it, along with a host, into a useful form. You mockingly whisper it to yourself in disbelief as you toss away the book. But when you feel something brush against your leg that sends a brief shiver of pleasure up your spine, you start to wonder if maybe there isn't something to his theories.</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>A summoning spell that pulls some extra-dimensional something or other into this realm, giving you a useful cloak or something. But it needs a host, willing or otherwise, and you're damn sure it isn't going to be you.</Description>

<DiscoveryMessage>As you move around the Treasure Chest Stage area, your eyes spot a beautiful Goth stripper making her act on stage. She seems to be whispering something, as you approach, she grabs you around the neck and whispers some gibberish in you ear. After some hard thinking, you realize she just gave you the magic words to make others like her.

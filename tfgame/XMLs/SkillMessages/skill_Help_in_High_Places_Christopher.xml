<DiscoveryMessage>You wander along, occasionally glancing at the objects left strewn about the mansion. It's not as if it is boring, there just simply isn't anything in here worth taking, seemingly consisting of only old rubbish and dust. A dresser catches your eye, or more specifically, a small book lying atop it. The pages are yellowed with age, but it is still legible. It appears to be a pamphlet for new maids starting at the mansion. There is an image of the full uniform, your eyes darting directly to the five inch platform heels. Did they really have to wear these?
You feel mildly jealous of their uniform, and a spell quickly forms in your mind, unbidden but not lacking for desire..</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>This sexy spell will persuade your target to take up your burden, so to speak, in the form of a pair of strappy platform high heels. You aren't sure where it came from, but you don't mind, and they don't matter!</Description>

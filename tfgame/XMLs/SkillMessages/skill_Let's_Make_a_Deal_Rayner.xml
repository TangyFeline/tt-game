<DiscoveryMessage>As you wander the eerie streets of this strange town a streetlight flickers to life in front of you. A sharp dressed man with his hat tipped forward looks from under its shadow, a toothy smile below. He beckons you forward with a white gloved finger and you come closer. "Let's make a deal..." He offers and pulls out a deck of cards. Time flies by but you've won his game of cards, he smirks and holds up a new card, an Ace of Spades. "Use it if you ever want to play another game.." He explained and the light flickered once more, when it returned to light the man had vanished. </DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>You stare at the black Ace of Spades in your hand, your prize from the dapper gentlemen you met in the streets earlier. A black magic emanates from it, the ink on the card runny, wavy as you look. You can feel the power within ready to have your magic caste through it, to summon a man like him to make another deal. </Description>

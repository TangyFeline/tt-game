<DiscoveryMessage>You arrive at the Oldport Concert Stage just in time to watch a singing competition - likely one of those televised reality shows.  Tonight seems to be a theme night; all the songs seem to be from the same artist, someone before your time.  You watch the contestants for awhile.  A Bitch in Heat gets booed off the stage, called a real hound dog by the judges.  A red-skinned woman, dressed in unusually bulky clothes as if she were hiding something, puts in a decent performance; but then a catgirl performs so poorly that one of the judges has to tell another not to be cruel. A young vampire Childe, sparking in the stage lights, clutches her ominous looking teddy bear throughout her number. The show goes on for some time. And it hits you - you could make a better singer than all of these women!  In your opinion, even though she did not win, the best singer by a wide margin was a shy drow maiden - so in her honor, you decide to construct your spell so that your new diva will also be ... Elvish.</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>Casting this spell will create a beautiful elvish woman with a superb singing voice, and a powerful stage presence.  Any similarity to persons living or (presumed) dead is entirely coincidental.</Description>

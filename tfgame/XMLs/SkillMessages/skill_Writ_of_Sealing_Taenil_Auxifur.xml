<DiscoveryMessage>As you pace through the weights room you come across a poster of a muscular, tattooed woman, her posture straight and rigid as she curls over fifty pounds with each arm at the same time.  One of the tattoos on her arm resembles a naked, busty woman, her body cartoonish but her face oddly realistic, quite a mismatch of art styles.  You ponder this, wondering if the tattoo is someone she once knew... or perhaps continues to know, the tattoo actually a poor soul trapped in ink embedded into her mistress's skin...</DiscoveryMessage>

<Description>This unique spell, when cast, transforms its victim into a little slip of paper with a designed inked in.  When held against one's skin the ink will transfer in the form of a tattoo.</Description>

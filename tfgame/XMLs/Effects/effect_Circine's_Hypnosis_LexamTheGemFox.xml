<Description>You were poking around in the bedroom of a young witch when you came across a silver doggy pendant.  You couldn't stop staring at it no matter how hard you tried.  Now you are crawling around on all fours and whimpering like a doggy.  You can no longer seem to focus on attacking others; you really want to roll onto your back and let people rub your belly instead!  But you have to fight this mind control, or else you just might wind up mentally stuck as a doggy forever.</Description>

<MessageWhenHit>You snoop around the little pink bedroom in the Milton house.  You blink as you discover a small silver pendant in the shape of a dog. You can't help but admire the object, even as it begins to glow. You moan softly as a wave of submissiveness overwhelms your human mind and you drop to your knees, putting your hand on the floor in front of you. You feel your tongue slip from your lip and begin to pant. You begin to feel horny, stupid, and obedient. You wriggle free of your clothing and crawl around naked, barking and acting like the doggy you knew you are. Somewhere in the back of your mind your human self is fighting to regain control, but it might take a while.</MessageWhenHit>

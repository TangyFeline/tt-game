<Description>You are in the Abandoned Erie Estate.  You are in the Erie family Mausoleum, a small graveyard with a few dozen graves dating back to the mid 1800s.  A large mausoleum rises out of the center, a stone monument commemorating the late Richard F. Erie, born 1876, died 1953, father of eight.  A heavy metal grate bars the way down into a dark stone staircase down into the actual crypt, chained up with not one, not two, but... eight different locks!  You feel a shiver run down your spine as you imagine what Richard's descendents were trying to keep out... or in.</Description>

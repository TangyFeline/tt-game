<Description>You are inside the Blazes and Glamour Beauty Spa, standing at the front desk where there is a distinct lack of a receptionist.  The walls are covered with professionally framed posters and photographs of beautiful women wearing an array of makeup and sporting a huge variety of hair styles.  Designer logos can be seen in virtually any direction, each trying to tell you how much more beautiful you can be if you simply buy their product.</Description>

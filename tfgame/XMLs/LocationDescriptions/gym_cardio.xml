<Description>You are in the aerobics room of the Sweater Girls Gym.  A dozen treadmills are lined up next to one another facing out towards the windows.  Large flatscreen televisions hang from the ceiling a bit in front of them, all of them muted and turned to different broadcast channels.  Although one machine's tread is strangely running, no gym members are in sight.</Description>

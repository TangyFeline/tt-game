<Description>You are in the abandoned Erie Estate.  You are in the servant quarters, a single large room with eight bunk bed where the mansion's staff once lived.  It doesn't look as though anybody has ever spent a night here for a long time.  A line of kitchen maid aprons are hung on wooden pegs, the fabric eaten away by moths.  A lone suitcase rests on the bottom mattress of one bunk bed, the lock smashed off and its contents strewn about as if someone had been frantically searching for something inside it.  What were they looking for, and who was doing the searching?  Why did they need to leave the mansion in such a hurry?  You sigh--you'll probably never know.</Description>

<Description>You are in the Abandoned Erie Estate.  You are standing in the western gardens, a series of flowerbeds and hedges now completely overgrown with shrubs and trees, but every now and then you can spot the remnants of an old birdbath, fountain, plaque, or statue.  In the middle is a gazebo so overgrown with vines that there doesn't appear to be any visible way through to the inside.</Description>

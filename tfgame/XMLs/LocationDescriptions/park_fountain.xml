<Description>You are standing in the a peaceful city park at a memorial fountain, a central area where all of the footpaths meet up at the center of the park.  A mixture of bright and shiny coins glitter from the bottom, at least those that aren't covered up by last autumn's fallen leaves.  A ring of cement benches line the fountain with a strangely lifelike and clean-looking stone statue of a well-endowed girl.  Is she one of your magic slinger peers?  You can't tell.</Description>

<Description>You are in the Sunnyglade Public Pool.  You are at the water slide, a big metal structure three floors high with twin water slides.  Climbing up a dozen or so short segments of stairs, you get a good view of the surrounding area.  You're tempted to jump into one of the slides and slip through the loops and curves and splash in the cool water below, but now may not be the time for that.</Description>

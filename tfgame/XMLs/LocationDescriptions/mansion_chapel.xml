<Description>You are in the abandoned Erie Estate.  You are standing in a small chapel built straight into the mansion--the Erie family must have been a religious bunch.  But as you expore the wooden pews and alter, gazing at the imagery in the stained glass windows, you realize that you have no idea what sect the chapel was meant for.

Your footsteps echo against the stone walls and ceiling, the sound bouncing around to the point you get the feeling that you're being followed, possibly by some unseen ghostly entity...</Description>

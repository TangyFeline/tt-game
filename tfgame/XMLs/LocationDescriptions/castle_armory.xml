<Description>You are in the armory of Valentine's Castle.  Light falling in from above seems to make everything shine. Various weapons and armours gleam brightly, making them seem alive. Most of the gear here looks like it has been never used before. There are tales in town that this equipment is cursed - you decide to leave it alone.</Description>

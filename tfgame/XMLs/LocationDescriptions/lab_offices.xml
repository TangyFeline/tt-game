<Description>You are in the offices of Dr. Hadkin's Research Clinic.  The offices consist of four small rooms, each occupied by a desk and heaps of papers, diagrams, and strange gizmos.  The papers all seem to be written in a strange shorthand or encryption.  Dr. Hadkin's personal office is locked tighted and not even your magic can open the magnetic locks.</Description>

<Description>You are standing at the front counters of a mid-sized clothing store named Ophalia's Embroidery.  The checkout counters are here but none are currently being attended.  A pair of yellow panties is draped on the counter with a name and some text on the tag instead of a price.  "Tim Garbocci.  Prefers being washed in warm water.  Very gentle but has a tendancy to rub during inappropriate times," the text reads.  You pick the garment up, staring at it and wondering if it is staring back at you.  It wiggles ever so slightly, zapping you with some static electricity.  Startled, you drop it back down on the counter and leave it be.</Description>

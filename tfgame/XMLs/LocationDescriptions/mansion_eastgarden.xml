<Description>You are in the Abandoned Erie Estate.  You are standing in the eastern gardens.  There was, or rather was, a long reflecting pool four feet deep.  It must have been beautiful in its prime, but now it's just a heap of cracked concrete halfway filled with rotting dead lives.  There's still a few inches of water in some areas, the liquid muddy and black like tar, reeking of decay.</Description>

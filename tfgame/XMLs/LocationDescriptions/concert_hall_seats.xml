<Description>You are in the audience area of the Oldport Concert Hall, a big empty area of the floor where maybe one or two hundred people can stand facing the stage.  The floor is dusty and littered with trampled fliers, cigarettes, an even the odd pair of discarded (regular, non-human) panties or thongs.  A bunch of fold up chairs are stacked against a wall for calmer events.</Description>

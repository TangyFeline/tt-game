<Description>You are in the records room of the Henryson Medical Clinic.  You are in the normally locked room filled with filing cabinets that hold thousands of tan folders containing the medical records of the clinic's patients.  The filing cabinets are dated alphabetically, identified by large worn stickers pasted over old ones that used to organize them by year instead.  One of the cabinets is open, the files rifled through with many folders torn out and tossed to the ground as if someone were urgently searching for something or other.</Description>

<Description>You are in the abandoned Erie Estate.  You are in the master baths, a cool tiled bathroom holding a few showers and a bathtub the size of a small swimming pool.  Two bronze statues of topless mermaids rest on opposite sides of the room, gazing at the bath in the center of the room with childishly innocent yet unsettling grins.  A Roman-style mosaic lines the walls, artistically arranged to show fish and sea creatures, only about half of which you recognize.  The rest seem to come from fairy tales or some insane writer's dreams--and in some cases, nightmares!</Description>

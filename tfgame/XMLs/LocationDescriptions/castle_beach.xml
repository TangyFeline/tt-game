<Description>You jump into one of the Secret Tunnels you stumbled upon earlier. Taking short, fast ride you suddenly realize that you're thrown on a beautiful sandy beach. Little grains in your palm reflect some of the light that dances playfully over them. Fresh breeze fills your nostrills making you raise your sight and gasp in amazement over the image of sea in front of you. You walk to the shore only to get your feet tickled by gentle waves that lick the sand every so often.</Description>

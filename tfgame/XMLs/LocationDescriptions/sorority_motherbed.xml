<Description>You are standing in the House Mother's bedroom of the sorority. Margaret Farnsworth is an alumna of St. Circe, who graduated from the university in 1970. She was known as a strict disciplinarian when she was elected President of the sorority in 1968, 1969 and 1970, making sure the house was kept nice and tidy, and that all the sisters performed exceptionally in the classroom. Miss Farnsworth was invited back to the SCCC Chapter of EGM after the unfortunate Sorority Sleep over of 2011 threatened the sorority's charter. Miss Farnsworth's first act as house mother was to instill discipline into the sorority. She did that by 'outfitting' the basement, and putting a large wooden paddle on the wall of her bedroom (which she knows how to use!). Fortunately for the current sisters, Miss Farnsworth is very hard of hearing, and likes to go to bed very early, so parties can still occur; the girls just need to make sure the house is picked up before she comes to.</Description>

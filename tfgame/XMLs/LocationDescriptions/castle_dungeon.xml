<Description>You are currently in the dungeon of Valentine's Castle. In the past years there have been many prisoners around here. Currently, the chamber lies empty and silence.  All of the cells are empty. You can feel however how scary a life here was. In the cell that you have examined you see nail scratches on every wall - seems that someone who was here wanted to escape really badly.</Description>

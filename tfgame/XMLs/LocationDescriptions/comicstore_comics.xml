<Description>You are in the Extended Universe Comic Book Store.  You are standing in a room filled with several longs bookshelves, each filled with comic books and mangas spanning decades and all sorts of genres both Western and Eastern.  There's a particularly large magical schoolgirl section, you notice with a smirk.  There are a few large cabinets in the room, locked up tight with highly valuable classic editions sealed behind glass, each comic book sealed in shrink wrap.</Description>

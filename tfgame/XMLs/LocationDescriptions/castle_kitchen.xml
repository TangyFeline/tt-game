<Description>You are in the kitchens of Valentine's Castle.  The spacious kitchen is just stunning. On the walls you can see cooking utensils that look like they were made for Lord themselves. A big marble table was used for preparing of the greatest food in town. Some cooking pots are still on it but there is no food around.</Description>

<Description>You are backstage in the Oldport Concert Hall.  The area is dark with all of the walls lined with boxes, a chaotic mashup of theatrical props, amps, guitars, and drums.  There are also a few mattresses where rockers and actors can get some rest, or based on a used, discarded condomn lying on the ground nearby, get a little action with attractive groupies.</Description>

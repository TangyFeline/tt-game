<Description>You are in the Treasure Chest, a somewhat small building with darkly translucent orange windows, impossible to see inside.  Once inside, you see several private booths line its walls, each with a great view of a stage, more comfortable seats, curtains that can be pulled to stop prying eyes and (more interestingly) a pole that stretches from the floor up through the center of the table and anchors to the ceiling.  The backstage area lies behind a thick, heavy red velvet curtain, shielding the occupants from prying eyes.  Mirrors line the walls back there to aid the girls in getting dressed, some of them with chairs and make-up tables sitting before them.</Description>

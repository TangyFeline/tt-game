<Description>You are in Sugarsand Station, a small local candy store.  You are in the kitchen, a small, tiled area with large ovens, pots, sheet trays, and all sorts of equipment for making chocolate, taffy, gummies, and countless other variations of foods that have an excess of sugar in common.  The counters are clean but the floors are filthy with dirt and dried tidbits of syrup and nuts with no small amount of roden droppings mingled among them.  You wonder how long it's been since a health inspector has been through here.</Description>

<Description>You are in Sugarsand Station, a small local candy store.  You are at crowded wooden counter, so cluttered with jars of licorice and sugar sticks and boxes of suckers that there's barely any place to do business.  An old cash register rests behind the counter, looking like an antique from the 1920's or even earlier.  It doesn't look as though the store has made a profit in a generation.</Description>

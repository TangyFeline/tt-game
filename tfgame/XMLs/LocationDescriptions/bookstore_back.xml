<Description>You are at the back area of Words of Wisdom, small mom and pop bookstore.  You are surrounded by cramped shelves filled with books about wars, rock and roll, fashion and girlie magazines... nothing that interests you at this time.  You think that you hear a cough from behind a shelf, but when you try to find out who made the noise you find nobody who could have made the noise.  You spin around, hearing a faint inaudible whisper, but once again you are greeted be nothing.  A strange thought pops in your head... could the books themselves be talking amongst themselves?  Strange things can happen when too many written words inhabit the same area, and Sunnyglade is nothing but strangeness.</Description>

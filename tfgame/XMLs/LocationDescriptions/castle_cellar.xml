<Description>You are in the cellar of Valentines' Castle.  You have never seen so much alcohol in your life!  Even in The Smelly Sorceress Tavern there is maybe just one percent of what you are seeing just now. But that's not all, there seem to be door leading even further inside. There are bottles of red wine, cognac, whisky. </Description>

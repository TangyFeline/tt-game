<Description>You are at the main apartment building of the Oldoak Apartment Complex.  The building is four floors tall, the upper floors accessible by old metal staircases with wobbly-looking railings.  Other than a lone television flickering through a window on the third floor, you don't see many signs of inhabitance at the moment.</Description>

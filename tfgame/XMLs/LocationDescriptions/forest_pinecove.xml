<Description>You are standing in the Pine Cove of the Scarlet Forest.  The ground here is covered with a bedding of soft orange pine needles fallen over the years,  the relatively thin branches of the pine branches above permitting light to make it to the ground, a rather welcome change from the sometimes suffocating canopy above.  you feel as though you could lay down and rest here a few minutes, close your eyes and let the you guard down, just for a second or two, really...  You shake your head, feeling an ambient magic amidst the silently watching pines.  Best not to linger here too long Lest your sleeping body be covered by needles and absorbed into the soil and roots or some other such curse.</Description>

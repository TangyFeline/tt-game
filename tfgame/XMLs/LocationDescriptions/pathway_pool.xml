<Description>A dirt road extends east and west here, bounded by light strands of trees to the north and south. To the east, it merges into the playground aside Sunnyglade Pool, thereby giving access to the town's Main Street; you can almost hear people splashing about in the pool's waters. In the other direction, it provides access to Sapphire Lake and the environs of the St. Circe's campus.</Description>

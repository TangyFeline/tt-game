<Description>You are at the Milton Ranch, a famous... or infamous... local landmark you've heard about from whispers and rumors.

A rooster eyes you territorially as you step around a large metal bucket half filled with milk next to a rusty pitchfork, your foot barely missing it as your eyes adjust to the dim lighting.</Description>

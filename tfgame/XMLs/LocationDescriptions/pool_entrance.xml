<Description>You are in the Sunnyglade Public Pool.  You are at the entrance, an wide path that passes through a building, a blue, plastic circular desk midway through where employees take money or membership passes.  Posters line the walls advertise local events and pool memberships between old half-empty vending machines.  Even from here you can smell the powerful scent of chlorine wafting on the warm breeze.</Description>

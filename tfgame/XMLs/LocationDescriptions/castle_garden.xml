<Description>As you walk by a seemingly ordinary grassy lot, something shimmers in your peripheral vision.  Suddenly you realize that the lot is not at all empty, not in the slightest!  You are standing in front of a massive yet beautiful gate made of pitch-black obsidian. Ingenious ornaments shine together with bits of crimson shattered red crystals on them. When you pushed the icy-cold wing of the gate you felt like a part of your life energy was just sucked off. You get the feeling that the time here completely stopped, and maybe some kind of giant wall of illusion is hiding this massive building in plain sight from ordinary residents.  Going further inside you feel a presence of powerful magic - it feels like it's living on it's own. A vague impression overflows you as you think that the trees around you whisper. </Description>

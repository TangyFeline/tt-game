<Description>You are in the main laboratory of Dr. Hadkin's Research Clinic.  In the center of the room sits one large rectangular table cluttered with machines, diagrams, mechanic components, strange biological samples, a whole myriad of oddities.  The table is stained, burned, melted, and at some parts greatly warped from some unknown power.  Clearly there is much science to be done.  You see an open trapdoor that leads down a set of dark stairs in one corner.</Description>

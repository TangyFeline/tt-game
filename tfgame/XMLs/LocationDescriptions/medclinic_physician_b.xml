<Description>You are in the Emergency Room A in the Henryson Medical Clinic.  It's nothing quite like what one might expect in a major hospital, but there are a few beds and enough supplies to keep the more critically sick or injured patients alive and recovering or else stable enough to be transferred to a hopsital in a nearby city.  Large electronic machines monitor the currently empty beds, beeping every now and then with their LED screen displaying some numbers you don't know much about.</Description>

<Description>With plenty of southern exposure, the back patio is a favorite haunt when the sorority sisters want to work on their tans, as attested by the empty bottles of tanning lotion scattered on the tiles near the lounge chairs. Pushed up against the house is an expensive-looking barbecue that doesnâ€™t seem to have been used much lately. Currently it serves as a handy rack for bikinis and underwear draped there by girls hoping to avoid tan lines. Off to the side are a few comfy patio chairs around a table with an umbrella. The empty glasses and half-full bottle of Cuervo sitting on the table offer mute testimony to what happens here after the sun sets. To the south the ground slopes away toward wooded country (known to be frequented by frat boys armed with binoculars) and the glistening blue waters of Sapphire Lake are visible through the trees to the southeast.</Description>

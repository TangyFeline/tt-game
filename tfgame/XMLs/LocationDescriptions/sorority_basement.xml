<Description>While parts of the room at the bottom of the stairs you descended could belong to any organization - one corner of the room is filled with boxes of seasonal decorations, excess kitchen utensils, and so forth - it is clear that this room is more than a mere 'basement'. While the large spool or rope in the corner might be innocuous, the chains on the wall, the paddles on that shelf - and is that a whip?! - suggest that this room's reputation as 'Mistress Maggie's Dungeon' may be more than just an idle rumor. Though the same rumor does also state that the sisters use it for their own hazing rituals... and that many an unwelcome intruder in the sorority house has wound up receiving quite a bit of unwanted attention in this room. Fortunately, the door leading back to the outside world is still open... for now.</Description>

<Description>You are in the Sunnyglade Public Pool.  You are by a jungle-themed concessions stand, a small, air-conditined building with just enough furnishings to heat up nachos, pretezels, a grill to cook hamburgers and hot dogs, a cooler for soft drinks, and a freezer for ice cream.  Although the metal roll-down mesh window is raised, there's nobody manning the cash register.</Description>

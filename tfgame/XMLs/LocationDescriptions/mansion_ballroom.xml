<Description>You are in the abandoned Erie Estate.  You stand inside an old ballroom, a carpeted hall with enough stringed instruments to equip a small orchestra resting in stands along the walls.  A gold-colored gramophone rests on a particularly ornate table, the insides of it filled with spider webs.  You give the crank a few turns, but nothing happens.  You imagine posh gentlemen and ladies waltzing on the worn carpet as musicians play in the corner, but the only sounds you hear now are your own breath and heartbeat.</Description>

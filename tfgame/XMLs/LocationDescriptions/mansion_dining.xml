<Description>You are in the Abandoned Erie Estate.  You are in the dining hall, a long room housing a giant polished wooden banquet table with a chandelier dangling from the ceiling.  The table is set as if awaiting guests, but if there had been any food on the table it either rotted away or was eaten by vermin.  You consider swiping some of the fine silverwear lining the plates--it must be worth a small fortune--but you have other things to worry about, like how you're going to avoid possibly spending the rest of your existence as a pair of panties or a statue.</Description>

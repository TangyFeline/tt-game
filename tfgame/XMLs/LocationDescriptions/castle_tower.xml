<Description>You are in the central tower of Valentine's Castle.  You are standing on a glorious spiraling stairway covered with red-velvet carpet. Ornate doors lead to different rooms of the castle.  From this high tower you can see whole town--it must be a powerful magic that caused you to fail to see the castle back from further in town.  You can notice some familiar places like Saint Circe's or further down the road the Smelly Sorceress Tavern. </Description>

<Description>You are standing by a particularly old and large oak tree, nearly a bald dozen feet in radius and rising up above all other trees in the nearby area.  Scientific estimates put its age at over five hundred years old but the rumor amongst your more magically minded peers is that it is actually thousands, predating modern man.  The tree bears the scars of old ax marks cleaved into its side before whatever enterprising lumberjack discoverd how thick the wood is, how invulnerable it is to the temporary passions of mortal men and women.  An old iron climbing look sits embedded about fifty feet up, abandoned when a climber fell to his death here a hundred and fifty years back, according to legend anyway.  Whatever the true is, you sense some kind of sentient but slumbering magic within its sap and choose to leave it be.</Description>

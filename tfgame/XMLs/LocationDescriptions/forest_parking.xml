<Description>You are in an unofficial gravel parking lot just off of the main road where hiking enthusiasts and adventurous local teens have made it a habit to stash their cars before adventuring into the woods.  The lot is empty except for an old rusted van missing all four wheels and it's rusted engine flayed apart, overgrown by encroaching grasses.  There are no official trails but a trail of slightly trampled terrain shows the way into the forest known as the Scarlet Forest.</Description>

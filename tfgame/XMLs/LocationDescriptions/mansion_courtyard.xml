<Description>You are in the Abandoned Erie Estate.  You are in the courtyard, a grassy area surrounded by the mansion's brick walls.  A large oak tree is planted in the middle, surrounded by a ring of seven stone benches.  On each bench sits a lifelike statue of a young woman, each highly detailed and unique.  You swear you hear whispering and approach them, and while you feel some kind of living magical... essence coming from the pale stone maidens, it's certainly not, nor ever was, human.  There's certainly more to this mansion that meets the eye...</Description>

<Description>You are at the front gate of the Abandoned Erie Estate.  A large set of heavy iron doors spans across the cobblestone paving, creaking in the wind and threatening to fall off with a deafening clang at any moment.  Beyond sits the abandoned Erie Estate, a large home that belonged to a millionaire and local legend whose ancestored owed their wealth to the long-forgotten canal industry.  But nobody has seen or heard from the known last owner or any of her relatives in thirty years.</Description>

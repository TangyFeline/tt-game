<Description>You are at the front gate of the Abandoned Erie Estate.  A large set of heavy iron doors spans the cobblestone paved driveway, creaking in the wind and threatening to fall off with a deafening clang at any moment.

But nobody has seen or heard from the known last owner or any of her relatives in thirty years.</Description>

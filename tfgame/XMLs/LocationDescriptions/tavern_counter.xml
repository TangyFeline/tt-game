<Description>You are at the bar counter of a local pub named The Smelly Sorceress sitting on the corner of 14 and Main.  A massive wooden sculpture of an unflattering fat woman with medusa-like snakes instead of hair scowls at you, her paint peeling away.  Hundreds of bottles of liquor rest of shelves behind her and an old jukebox plays some music from the eighties.</Description>

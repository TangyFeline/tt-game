<Description>You are in the treasury of Valentine's Castle.  You are instantly struck with a dizziness as you take your first steps inside.  Your knees grow shaky and you can't believe yourself. Gold, crystals and gems - everywhere! Wherever you look you see piles of valuable items. You try to get closer to them but at the moment when you wanted to fetch some - you bump on your head.  It seems that some invisible power protects the goods from being taken away.  You pull yourself back on your feet and keep silent, though your awe remains.</Description>

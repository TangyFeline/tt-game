<Description>You are in the Treasure Chest, a strip club.  You have snuck in to the manager's office, a cluttered room filled with old posters of models over the past few decades.  A cigarette-burned and whiskey-stained desk sits in one corner with an old computer humming in the corner.  There a crooked, oddly dust-free painting behind the desk that rather obviously is hiding a small safe in the wall, its contents probably jealously guarded by the club's undoubtedly shady owner.  </Description>

<Description>You are in the servant quarters of Valentine's Castle.  This area was once a place that was used by most of castle live-ins. You can see some simple beds with modest bedside cabinets. Even so, you think that live here must have been easy and pleasant--certainly more so than at the Erie Estate, at any rate.</Description>

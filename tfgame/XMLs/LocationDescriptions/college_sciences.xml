<Description>You are standing at the sciences classroom of the small Saint Circe's Community College.  Instead of an old chalkboard or even a whiteboard, the front of the room boats a single large smart board, though there are still some marker smears from the absent-minded professor.  Chemicals, scales, lab coats, and other science-y stuff is locked away inside an array of glass cabinets.</Description>

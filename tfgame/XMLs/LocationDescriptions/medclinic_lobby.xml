<Description>You are in the lobby / waiting area of the Henryson Medical Clinic, a small facility where the residents of the town go for their less medical emergencies and routine checkups.  The building looks old and the fact that some of the public announcement posters on the wall are several decades old doesn't help much.  A glass jar full of suckers rests on the counter of the payee window for children to treat themselves to after their shots.  A mural advertising cigars that was sloppily painted over some years ago is starting to reveal itself as the overlying paint chips and peels away, showing you just how much the world has changed in the past century.  And with so many powerful mages fighting and practicing their arts here, you get the feeling it may be changing again soon once the strongest and most amitious take their new power back to their home provinces and nations.</Description>

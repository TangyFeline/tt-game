<Description>You are standing at the end of a deep, winding tunnel in the Silent Caverns that ends in a massive underground lake.  The rare sight is breathtaking, something like a scene out of Journey to the Center of the Earth--a deathly black lake lies still, undisturbed, hundreds of metres across beyond the reach of the eye.  The domed room is covered with glowing pink crystals--perhaps the source of the arcane energy that seems to linger everywhere in the town, and maybe what the builders of the Valentine Castle harvested to build their own mystical halls.  You are constrained to a small portion of the shore.  Some bioluminescent pink fish swim by, suddenly swallowed up by a dark shadow, some kind of predator lurking in the deep.</Description>

<Description>You are standing at the end of a deep, winding tunnel in the Silent Caverns that ends in a massive underground lake.  The rare sight is breathtaking, something like a scene out of Journey to the Center of the Earth--a deathly black lake lies still, undisturbed, hundreds of metres across beyond the reach of the eye.  The ceiling of the domed chamber is covered with glowing pink crystals--perhaps the source of the arcane energy that seems to linger everywhere in the town.  Unfortunately you are constrained to only a small stretch of shoreline as the lake touches up right against the sloping walls a few dozen meters to either your right and left, though there does appear to be another one at the opposite end, if only you could reach it.  Some bioluminescent pink fish swim by, suddenly swallowed up by a dark shadow, some kind of predator lurking in the deep.</Description>

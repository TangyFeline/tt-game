<Description>You are at the Milton Ranch, a famous... or rather, an infamous local landmark you've heard about from whispers and rumors.  You are standing in a cute pink bedroom inhabited by a teenage girl known as Circine.  She is said to live here, learning magic from her Aunt Circe... or Donna, depending on which name you dare refer to her by to her face or friends.  The room is mostly clean except for a heap of clothes in which only half have actually made it inside a laundry hamper, the rest spilled out around it.</Description>

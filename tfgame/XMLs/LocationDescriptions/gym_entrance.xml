<Description>You are at the front desk of the Sweater Girls Gym, a small workout center designed to appeal to trendy young women.  In contrast to much of the rest of town, the building looks very with large clean windows giving watchers outside a look at where women would be excersizing inside.  Despite this, however, you don't see any staff or regular members.</Description>

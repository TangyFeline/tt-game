<Description>You are standing at the front of a carousel in the peaceful Sunnyglade Park.  Although there are no children around, or even a ride operator, the carousel is playing cheerful organ tunes while the painted mechanical ponies rise and fall, racing around the track never gaining or losing ground to the ponies in front and behind them.</Description>

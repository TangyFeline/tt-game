<Description>You are at the Milton Ranch, a famous... or rather, an infamous local landmark you've heard about from whispers and rumors.  You are standing next to some livestock pens where cows, chickens, pigs, and horses roam around in their respective pens and fenced in lots.  Some seem to eye you as you approach with an almost human interest--sizing you up against the legendary Circe?  Maybe looking at you longingly as if you could restore them to human form?  Or maybe, just maybe, they are just plain old animals and you smell bad--the wind is blowing in their direction, after all...</Description>

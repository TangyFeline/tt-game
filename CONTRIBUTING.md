# Contributing to Transformania Time

Thank you for your interest in making Transformania Time better!

## Contributing spells and quests
[Spells]((https://www.transformaniatime.com/contribution/contribute/-1)),
[curses](https://www.transformaniatime.com/contribution/contributeeffect/-1)
and [quests](https://www.transformaniatime.com/questwriter) may be submitted
on the website.

## Contributing code
The [project readme](https://gitlab.com/transformania/tt-game) has documentation
on getting your development environment set up. We accept merge requests but do
ask that you search the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/transformania/tt-game/-/issues)
and create an issue if there isn't one already, unless you're submitting a trivial
fix that does not impact game balance.

## Contacting us
Transformania Time has an [active Discord](https://discord.gg/z66CYzX) which the
developers and many users frequent. This is the best way to contact us with any
questions or comments about the game, the merge request process, or any other
issues you may have.

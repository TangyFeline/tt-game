Thank you for your interest in making Transformania Time better!

## Spells and curses
[Spells]((https://www.transformaniatime.com/contribution/contribute/-1)) and 
[curses](https://www.transformaniatime.com/contribution/contributeeffect/-1) may
be contributed on the website.

## Quests
[Quest writing](https://www.transformaniatime.com/questwriter) requires special
permissions on your TT account, please [contact us on Discord](https://discord.gg/z66CYzX)
or [ask a question](https://www.transformaniatime.com/report/question) on the website
if you would like to become a quest writer. This permission is reserved for those
with accounts in good standing and who have had other content accepted into the game. 

## Tomes and Jewdewfae encounters
If you would like to submit writing for a spell tome or Jewdewfae encounter,
please [contact us on Discord](https://discord.gg/z66CYzX) or
[ask a question](https://www.transformaniatime.com/report/question) on the website
and it will be considered for addition to the game.

## Code submission
The [project readme](https://gitlab.com/transformania/tt-game) has documentation
on getting your development environment set up. We accept merge requests but do
ask that you search the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/transformania/tt-game/-/issues)
and create an issue if there isn't one already, unless you're submitting a trivial
fix that does not impact game balance.

## Contacting us
Transformania Time has an [active Discord](https://discord.gg/z66CYzX) which the
developers and many users frequent. This is the best way to contact us with any
questions or comments about the game, the merge request process, or any other
questions you may have.

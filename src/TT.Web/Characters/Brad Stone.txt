[Desc]               <blue>Standing before you is Brad Stone, a young man entering the competition with only money in mind. Being close friends with his girlfriend, Brenda, you know all too well of his argumentative, sometimes violent disposition. That said, you feel nervous in bringing any of this up with him. With a rather smug expression on his face, he cracks his knuckles loudly and says, "Let's get this show on the road, shall we?"</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>Standing before you now is Tabitha Mercer, a far cry from her previous form. She has a very cute figure, with plush filling just the right places, even if she is quite skinny overall. When the host announces you the winner, she breathes out a huge sigh, like she was holding onto it for the entire show. Hanging out with Brenda the following week, you are saddened to hear that she and Tabitha didn't become friends after, with Brenda commenting that she "couldn't get a word out of her". Even though you never see Brad or Tabitha again, you wish her the best at whatever her new life brings.</pink>;

[SHOULDERS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Brad's shoulder length is probably your arm length. They are the size a football player would have- after putting on their gear.;
[short]               wide and imposing shoulders;
[tgShade]            shoulders 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Brad squirms a bit as his shoulders cave in. They're still bigger than yours, but seem to have a more, human-like structure, for lack of a better term. Brad is obviously not happy with the change, stomping his feet like some sort of enraged bull.;
[status]               Brad still has a broad shoulder width, although he certainly thinks of it as a major loss, occasionally giving you a death glare.;
[short]               broad shoulders;
[tgShade]            shoulders 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Brad narrows again, his shoulders looking closer to those of the average sized host. All of the excess hair has fallen off as well, landing on his $SHIRT$. ;
[status]               Brad has average shoulders, maybe a little girly looking. ;
[short]               average shoulders;
[tgShade]            shoulders 66;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Brad's shoulders shrink once again, creating a silhouette that can only be considered as feminine. Brad rubs them in consideration, but says nothing of the change.;
[status]               Brad has slim and hairless shoulders that never seem to stop slouching. You think that this isn't from bad posture, but more from Brad's nerves. ;
[short]               narrow and slouched shoulders;
[tgShade]            shoulders 100;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Brad's voice is an alto, which sounds strange coming from his $BODY$. His $MIND$ means that you needn't worry about him shutting up anytime soon.;
[short]               loud, alto voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Brad begins his usual string of insults, but is greeted with laughter instead. It takes him a few seconds to understand what's going on. His vocal register has changed slightly, making an already high voice even higher.;
[status]               If you thought Brad's voice was high and annoying before... well, it still was, but this new change hasn't helped matters. He now has an even higher voice that is a few registers below a Looney Tunes cartoon, with all of the anger.;
[short]               loud tenor voice;
[tgShade]            voice 25;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Brad starts to complain about the game again, but is again greeted with laughter. His voice, while not getting any higher, has definitely softened in tone, becoming almost delicate. One might even confuse it for a girl's voice. Brad copes with this change by refusing to talk.;
[status]               Brad's voice has since softened, becoming less of an assault on your ears. It helps that the recent change rendered him unwilling to talk.;
[short]               soft tenor voice;
[tgShade]            voice 50;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Winning again, you see Brad put one of his $HANDS$ to his throat, as if in mild discomfort. When the announcer comes over to interview him, it takes some prodding to get him to talk. When he finally opens up, you notice how unsure his voice has gotten, with odd inflections.;
[status]               Brad's voice hasn't raised, but he's now stuttering much more often. His inflections have also changed, raising on certain stresses that remind you of how girls typically talk. ;
[short]               soft and stuttering girly voice;
[tgShade]            voice 75;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               After that last round, you are surprised that there is no visible change to Brad. Did you win? The host comes over for their questioning, however, they can't get a word out of Brad. It turns out that the mic was too far away, and you hear a soft "i'm okay".;
[status]               Brad's voice is a stuttering soprano. His $MIND$ means that you won't be hearing him speak anytime soon.;
[short]               quiet, quivering soprano;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Even after spending a few minutes with him, you can understand Brenda's complaints about Brad. He looks as confident and cocky as ever, and you sometimes spot him arguing with the host or catcalling a girl in the audience, before turning to you with an arrogant look. You need to take this guy down. ;
[short]               brash and callous mind;
[tgShade]            mind 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Brad looks like he's completely lost, his eyes staring into space. When the host gets his attention, he lashes out in his usual display of insults, but they sound more from surprise than from mean-spiritedness. ;
[status]               Something definitely happened in that last round, but you can't see any outward changes, although Brad's eyes are no longer on the audience, instead shifting around warily. Other than that, he's as talkative as before, but maybe a bit more... reactionary.;
[short]               slightly on edge appearance;
[tgShade]            mind 20;
[WaitFor]           face 1;
[WaitFor]           voice 1;
[WaitFor]           shoulders 1;
[WaitFor]           hands 1;
[WaitFor]           pants 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Brad stares into space again. When the host wakes him up, you expect a tirade of insults to follow, but instead you hear something new. "Yeah, yeah. Calm down, I was just, just thinking about Brenda. I guess I've been too hard on her, y'know? Whatever, let's just keep playing, ok?" Even though you and the audience notice his sudden change in demeanour, Brad doesn't, fidgeting with his $PANTS$. There's no doubt anymore. Brad's mind is changing.;
[status]               Brad seems a little more quiet and withdrawn. Maybe the changes are getting to him, but the look in his eyes shows a conflict going on in his mind. ;
[short]               careful and conflicted mind;
[tgShade]            mind 40;
[WaitFor]           breasts 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Once again, Brad's eyes stare off into space. This time, the host gently puts a hand on his $SHOULDERS$, causing a yelp from Brad. After regaining his bearings, he mutters a "sorry" under his breath. That might have been the first time you've heard him apologize this game! ;
[status]               All the bravado and pomph that Brad expressed at the beginning of the show has been snuffed out, in its place, a fearful and quiet personality. He frankly looks uncomfortable being in his own skin, flinching whenever a loud noise occurs, before quickly apologising.;
[short]               nervous and quiet disposition;
[tgShade]            mind 60;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Brad absentmindedly adjusts a strap on his bra while humming nervously. It's obvious that something has changed in his mind to a more... feminine demeanour. When he catches everyone staring at him, he almost jumps out of his $PANTS$. "Sorry! Did I... did I do something wrong?";
[status]               Brad is still nervous and introverted, but he is now showing off more feminine actions. Every time he is caught exhibiting one, he apologises meaninglessly.;
[short]               girlish, frightened mind;
[tgShade]            mind 80;
[WaitFor]           groin 4;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               After losing that round, Brad comes up to you with a nervous look on his $FACE$. "Uh, good job out there... I mean, with the game. I don't mind that I lost, really. I mean, I guess I would have rather won, but... Oh! No, I didn't mean it like that! I meant that, like, you played really well. I'm sorry. I promise I'll play better next time..." He spends another few minutes stammering before the host has to lead him back to the podium.;
[status]               Brad is shy, frightened, and withdrawn. The roar of the crowds seem to scare him near to tears, and he twiddles his thumbs, looking like he would rather be anywhere but here. In short, he's the type of girl you wouldn't dream seeing as a contestant in a televised gameshow.;
[short]               excessively shy and nervous mind;
[tgShade]            mind 100;
[WaitFor]           hair 4;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Even if his $SHOES$ are in the way, you can tell that Brad has some pretty big feet. ;
[short]               large feet;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Brad nearly falls to the floor, gripping the podium just in time. Shooting daggers at any giggling in the audience, he pulls himself up, but not without a quick look at his $SHOES$. Something must have happened to his feet.;
[status]               After his stumble after a previous round, you feel safe to assume that something has happened to his feet.;
[short]               assumedly large feet;
[tgShade]            feet 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Again Brad nearly collapses,struggling to stay on his feet. "Okay, this is starting to get annoying. Cut it out!" Seems like his feet have changed again.;
[status]               You still haven't seen Brad's feet, but you know for certain that they have shrunk again. Every so often, he grips the podium as if to regain his balance.;
[short]               small feet;
[tgShade]            feet 66;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Brad stumbles a bit, before removing his $SHOES$. With that, you finally get to look at his feet. They are petite, with a slight arch and shiny toenails, shiny enough that polish must have been put on them. Brad attempts to rub off the polish, before realising that he is being filmed, and jolts back up, puttiing back on his shoes and socks.;
[status]               Even if his $SHOES$ are in the way, you know that Brad has some small feet. You also know that there's some polish on his little toenails.;
[short]               petite feet;
[tgShade]            feet 100;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Brad's hands are cut and callused, his fingernails being the only clean part about them.;
[short]               callused and rough hands with clean nails;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Brad looks at his hands in shock as the cuts and calluses suddenly heal themselves. "What the fuck!? I worked years to get those scars!" Not the reaction you were expecting.;
[status]               Brad's hands have been cleared of their cuts, revealing smooth and soft skin. It looks like he's never worked a day in his life, something that he's clearly pissed about.;
[short]               healthy hands with clean fingernails;
[tgShade]            hands 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Brad loudly cracks his knuckles, before looking at them in shock. His hands have grown smaller, but the fingers have remained roughly the same, perhaps a bit thinner. ;
[status]               Brad's hands aren't exactly those of a woman's, but would look out of place on a man. His fingers have thinned out, and his nails have lengthened. ;
[short]               slim hands with thin fingers;
[tgShade]            hands 66;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               While Brad is twiddling his thumbs nervously, he recoils and gazes at them in a panic. Not much changes with the hands themselves, but the fingers become even thinner, with nail polish smattered on his nails. When you look at them again, you see that a black ring has appeared on his left pinky finger. When did that happen?;
[status]               Brad's hands are smooth and pretty, with light polish on his fingernails. There is a plain black ring on his left pinky finger that looks like obsidian. ;
[short]               small and smooth hands with a black ring on his left pinky;
[tgShade]            hands 100;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Brad has a pair of navy jogging shorts on with too many pockets to be functionable. You can see a candy wrapper in one pocket, some rubber bands in another, and most disturbingly, what looks to be a knife in his front left pocket.;
[short]               navy, over-pocketed jogger's shorts;
[tgShade]            pants 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Brad suddenly pats his shorts down in a panic. "You motherfuckers! Where did my stuff go?!" Sure enough, his shorts have far fewer pockets than you remember seeing.;
[status]               Brad's jogging shorts have been left mostly unchanging, barring the disappearance of their pockets. He occasionally fiddles with them, as if the contents magically reappeared without him knowing.;
[short]               navy jogger's shorts;
[tgShade]            pants 20;
[WaitFor]           hair 2;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Brad's bland jogging shorts lengthen to his knees, while becoming a bluer colour. Brad checks to see if his pockets have returned, and glares at you when he finds nothing.;
[status]               Brad's jogging shorts have lengthened to his knees, looking almost like those silly exercise tights you often see bikers in. Aside from the lack of pockets, Brad is unmoved by the change.;
[short]               knee-length navy blue jogging pants;
[tgShade]            pants 40;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               This time Brad's pants don't lengthen, but change into a pair of jeans instead, the fabric tightening into denim. ;
[status]               Brad's jogging shorts have turned into a pair of unremarkable blue jeans. ;
[short]               dark blue jeans;
[tgShade]            pants 60;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               The jeans Brad is wearing tighten up into a pair of skinny jeans. Just when you think the change is over, Brad squirms a bit, and sneaks a look underneath. "I think... I think my underwear has changed...";
[status]               Brad's jeans have shrunken, now conforming to his $LEGS$. He fidgets at the sides, trying to find pockets that have long since disappeared.;
[short]               blue skinny jeans;
[tgShade]            pants 80;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Brad squeaks in shock as his pants change drastically. The pant legs merge into one, and gain a few ruffles, until he is left with a pretty pastel blue skirt that covers his $LEGS$. Even so, Brad puts his $HANDS$ over it until he is sure that it covers his $GROIN$.;
[status]               Brad has a long light blue skirt that reaches his $LEGS$. He smooths it out frequently in what looks like nervousness. ;
[short]               pastel blue full skirt;
[tgShade]            pants 100;

[GROIN];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You can't see Brad's groin underneath his $PANTS$, but judging by both his bulge and his smirking expression, you can reasonably assume that there's some girth involved.;
[short]               impressive looking bulge;
[tgShade]            groin 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Brad's $FACE$ contorts in pain as he keels over, $HANDS$ clutching at his groin. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what changed this round.;
[status]               Daring to peek at Brad's groin again, you infer that the bulge in his pants isn't as pronounced as it was before.;
[short]               unremarkable groin;
[tgShade]            groin 20;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Brad contorts in the same pained expression he had when his groin shrank, and you make a quick glance at it, revealing... nothing. Not even an outline in his $PANTS$. He pats his crotch frantically, before sighing in relief. It must still be there, somewhat.;
[status]               Brad's penis is apparently still there, but it has shrunk considerably. This must be a shock to his already $MIND$.;
[short]               lack of any visible bulge;
[tgShade]            groin 40;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Yet again, Brad makes the face that can only mean his groin has changed. This time, he slowly lowers his $PANTS$, before raising them back in a panic when he realises where he is. It's no use, the cameras and screens are now showing a penis that looks barely an inch, with no balls in sight. He covers his $FACE$ with his $HANDS$ while turning away from the cameras, and you swear you can hear... crying?;
[status]               Now that Brad has lowered his $PANTS$, however shortly, you can now see the changes you have caused to his groin. His penis is the size of a thumbnail, and his balls must have retracted back into his body. He doesn't seem to be over this fact.;
[short]               barely visible micropenis with no balls;
[tgPoint]            groin;
[tgShade]            groin 60;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Brad makes a rather unmasculine moan as he collapses to the ground, clutching his abdomen. He squirms around for a bit, although it looks more in discomfort, rather than pain. He then lays on the ground for a couple of minutes, a guilty expression on his $FACE$. Once the host finally help him up, he murmurs what the audience has already figured out, "I think I'm a girl now...";
[status]               Brad is now a she, as his miniscule penis has turned into the clit of a new pussy. ;
[short]               virgin slit;
[tgShade]            groin 80;
[WaitFor]           voice 3;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               A blush starts to form on Tabitha's face as he rubs his hands down the front of his $PANTS$, before slowly putting one of his $HANDS$ inside. Once he realises that the audience (and subsequently, the world) is watching, he pulls it out with a quiet squeak. "No! I-I'm sorry. It's not- it's not what it looks like, I swear! I was just checking, no, not in that way, though! It was just, it was just..." she lowers his voice in shame, "it felt different, that's all." Sound like Tabitha's vagina has finished changing.;
[status]               You still can't see Brad's groin under his $PANTS$, but judging by his previous actions, and how he keeps his $HANDS$ in front of it, as if he was almost ashamed of it, you can assume that it is a normal, healthy vagina. You don't eye that area too heavily, though, as he looks quite terrified when you do.;

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Brad has an impressive, if short, 5'7 body, all rippled with muscles except, strangely, for his $WAIST$. You remember hearing that his and Brenda's heights were a major source of contention for him. His skin is so tanned it almost looks bronze. You think you heard Brenda once say that he was 24, but you can't really remember.;
[short]               muscular, 5'7body with heavily tanned skin;
[tgShade]            body 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Brad screams out as he collapses to the floor. The host and some of the security come rushing forth, but are all shoved away. After some uncomfortable minutes of hollering, he picks himself up again, to reveal... not much. Maybe an inch was taken off, maybe his skin has lightened, but nothing that seems as painful as he was making it out to be. Brad flings insults at anyone who questions his outburst. Ok then...;
[status]               Even if Brad made a fuss over it, not much has changed in his body. Maybe some of his structure has changed, but the more you look at him, the more you think you're making up changes just to compensate for his behaviour. ;

[WaitFor]           waist 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Brad looks around, almost as if looking for an audience for his next freakout. When he sees indifference in the crowd and host, he relaxes as his body thins out into an almost gangly figure. It's clear that some of his bones has shrunk, while others have grown.;
[status]               Brad's body is strange looking, not unlike one you would see on a child. His shape is almost a tube shape, with his skin looking not as dark as before.;
[short]               skinny, awkward figure with tanned skin;
[tgShade]            body 40;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Brad's body changes again, with his hips growing out slightly while other sections of him start to fill out. It is just then that you realise how androgynous his new body has become. Brad seems to notice it too, shifting his $SHIRT$ about to hide his new frame. While this is happening, his skin starts to lose more of its golden sheen.;
[status]               If you didn't know Brad's gender beforehand, you might be confused over it. His hips have widened and his body has slimmed down overall, leaving him 2 inches shorter at 5'5. Looking at Brad's $FACE$, you can tell that he knows what's happening.;
[short]               androgynous body with only slightly tanned skin;
[tgShade]            body 60;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               "I feel... tingly..." Brad utters as he clenches himself, gripping his $WAIST$ tightly. Upon regaining composure, you can clearly see some differences, such as widened hips and a smaller chest, and even though he didn't shrink again, his body looks more... youthful. The biggest change is his skin, looking much paler than before. ;
[status]               Brad is now starting to look like a girl, with pronounced hips and a slightly smaller $WAIST$. ;

[tf]               You watch in curiousity and mild confusion as Brad's frame changes without him even realising it. Of course, when he does, he squeals in fright, shivering next to his mirror and shaking his head rapidly. When he finally opens his eyes, he sees that nothing huge has been altered, except her paler skin and some more pronounced chest. She turns back to you, blushing furiously. "Sorry...";
[status]               Brad still has an impressive body, but not in the way he started. Instead of a buff, masculine figure, he has a svelte feminine figure, with curves that properly compliment his $BREASTS$ and $WAIST$. He has palewhite skin with some pock marks around her back. If you had to guess, he looks to be in his late teens, no older than 19.;

[tf]               For a long time, nobody notices any changes, and Brad is subsequently prodded by the host to find them. It's only when he attempts to knee the host that the changes are finally revealed. His crocs have lightened in hue, and gained a strap. You can clearly see the relief on Brad's face, as well as the disappointment in the host's.;
[status]               The only things that has changed about Brad's shoes are that they have gained a strap, and slightly lighter coloured. ;

[tf]               Brad looks down in shock as his crocs transform. The strap splits off into shoelaces, the trademark holes merge together, and the heel hardens. What were once ugly crocs have turned into still ugly white gym sneakers. Brad bounces around on them, before deciding that they fit ok.;

[tf]               Brad's shoes shrink to fit his $FEET$, but otherwise remain unchanged. What instead changes is his socks, lengthening until they are knee height. Brad looks down at them and is about to make a comment, but decides against it. ;
[status]               Brad's pink sneakers look worn, but otherwise well maintained. You infer that the scuff marks on them are from him shuffling his $FEET$. He has comfy looking, but very girly knee-high socks that, unlike his sneakers, look very well-maintained.;

[status]               Most of the impressive physique on Brad's chest has melted away, leaving him with a still fit, but not near as muscular pair of pecs. It looks more like a swimmer's chest than the near-bodybuilder's form he once had.;

[status]               Brad's chest looks a bit out of shape. He has the faintest outline of moobs, and you can clearly see that it's pissing him off.;

[tf]               You see two little points poke out from Brad's shirt, creating what could only be nipples. Brad touches one, and the face that it creates on him proves that they're not just for show.;
[status]               Brad's chest now has the telltale sign of nipples protruding from his $SHIRT$. From what you've seen of Brad curiously touching them, they are pretty sensitive. ;

[status]               What were once moobs have upgraded to boobs. While they wouldn't even classify as an A cup, they are just perky enough to differentiate themselves from just fatty tissue, with small protrusions poking out of his $SHIRT$.;

[tf]               Brad's breasts finally grow out, leaving him with a respectable, if small, A cup. He blushes as he tries to hide them with his $ARMS$ to no avail, as the cameras have got all the shots they need.;
[status]               Brad sports a nice looking pair of A cup breasts. Not that he seems to think so, as he squirms uncomfortably whenever someone takes a peek at his slight cleavage.;

[HAIR];

[tf]               Brad's hair grows out just enough to get rid of his dreadful buzzcut, darkening as it grows. Brad shrugs and keeps going.;

[tf]               Brad shakes his head a bit as his hair continues to grow, now down to his shoulders, and turns into a brown. He looks at it in the mirror, before grabbing one of those stupid rubber band bracelets from a pocket in his $PANTS$ and ties it in a sort of short ponytail. ;

[tf]               Brad scratches his neck before realising that his ponytail has unraveled. His hair has also grown longer, reaching just past his shoulders, while darkening again to a pitch black. Brad attempts to find another band to tie it back again, before remembering his changed $PANTS$ and sighing.;
[status]               Brad's hair has come undone from his ponytail and now reaches his $SHOULDERS$ again, becoming a black colour. Every so often, he brushes hairs out of his $FACE$. ;

[status]               Brad has long black hair tied haphazardly back with a white scrunchie into a makeshift ponytail. While not messy in the least, it's clear that he doesn't spend all day on the style.;

[FACE];

[status]               Brad's face is ruggedly handsome. He has piercing blue eyes and a chin so sharp that it could probably substitute as a steakknife, on it, a tasteful amount of dark stubble, that make you wonder if he dyes his $HAIR$. He shares his eyes between you and the girls in the audience.;

[tgShade]            face 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Brad shakes his head rapidly, as if trying to shake off a very clingy hat. Once he stops, you can see that his face has changed, as his cheekbones have softened, his eyes have grown a bit, and his stubble is nowhere to be found. All in all, it's not a bad look for him, but you'd still rather not inform him of the changes.;
[status]               Brad still has a rather handsome face, but it has lost its rough and intimidating edges, looking more like someone you'd hang out with rather than run away from.;

[tf]               Brad makes a face and slaps himself comically, as if trying to wake himself up. When the slapfest dies down, his face has changed again, with a smaller nose, and more pronounced lips. This time, there's no hiding the changes from him, and he recoils when he looks at himself in the mirror.;
[status]               Brad has a 'pretty boy' kind of face. While not exactly feminine per se, it is a far cry from the Adonis that he came in with. ;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Brad grips his head with his $HANDS$ and you faintly hear the sound of teeth grinding. When he looks up, you notice that this time, his entire head has changed. It's become smaller, while his facial features have remained the same size, creating this weird effect that makes his face quite androgynous. ;
[status]               Brad's face has undergone an androgynous look to it. His head is smaller, and his eyes don't look as intense as they were starting out. ;

[tf]               Brad scrunches his face up as it begins to change again, this time becoming more girly. His nose shrinks to better fit the rest of his head, and his eyelashes lengthen, while his eyebrows thin out. It takes a couple of minutes for you to see that his eye colour has also changed from blue to green. ;
[status]               Brad's face is still a bit androgynous, but leaning a bit towards the girly side. His green eyes probably look the most feminine, but his lips and cheeks certainly don't belong to a man.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               There is not much left to change of Brad's face, but you can see some alterations. Lips are brightened, lashes are lengthened, and there is a slight darkening around his eyes, like he doesn't get that much sleep. When Brad looks in the mirror to confront the change, he spends so much time inspecting it, looking for flaws, that the host has to pull him back to the game.;
[status]               Brad's face is delicately feminine. He has soft green eyes and cute button nose, with lips that never seem to stop quivering. All in all, he looks terrified to be here, and constantly darts her eyes around, almost like he is looking for an exit. ;

[tf]               The grey shirt that Brad is wearing changes ever so slightly, as the neck plunges downward and the sleeves grow out and loosen. Even though nothing substansial has changed, it's clear that the shirt is now a girl's cut.;

But that's not the only change. You can see the white straps of a bra containing his $BREASTS$. Brad breathes out in what almost sounds like a sigh of relief. ;
[status]               Brad now wears an unspectacular grey blouse. The biggest change is a white bra that supports his new $BREASTS$.;

[status]               Brad has a loose white blouse on, loose enough that you can almost see the straps of his pink bra and a bit of cleavage from his $BREASTS$. It looks very clean, with not a wrinkle in sight. ;

With that, the cameras quickly spin around to his rear, but you can't see very much in the way of change- not that you were very perceptive towards the shape of behind to begin with. Maybe it looks a little thicker, a little less muscle, perhaps, but nothing as drastic as how Brad is making it out to be.;

[status]               Brad's ass is getting plumper, with most of the visible muscle gone and replaced with a tasteful amount of fat that doesn't quite fit a man, but would look slightly out of place on a girl.;

[Desc]               <pink>You are Erika Lenst, a bored, out of work teen babysitter, over the age of consent, who isn't sure how she got on this show but isn't complaining because it's good money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Still, if you're lucky losing could work out just as well as winning, at least, from the rumours you won't care anymore.</pink>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>You WERE Erika Lenst, now it's Erika Nagendra, no older but now far wiser, or at least more knowledgeable then before. It's surprisingly easy to keep the memories of your actual past from the memories of your new body's past, though to be on the safe side you're definitely going to call your mother, old and new, before heading to class.</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your voice, in your opinion, is an average one.;
[short]               average feminine voice;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               When you answer a question the hosts asks, you find your voice has changed, it's not a hiss, it hasn't gotten higher or lower, if anything it's more... clipped.;
[status]               You don't know why it sounds, and feels, like your you stop talking faster then your mouth closes.;
[short]               clipped speech but otherwise normal voice;
[WaitFor]           custom2 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You got to ask for some water and notice your voice has changed again, not in pitch or tone but in timbre...
It's different, and you think it'll take some time before you stop asking yourself, 'Is that my voice?'.;
[status]               You've gotten more control over whatever was clipping your words as you spoke so you've stopped doing that, but instead of sighing after sighing you find yourself giving a growling hiss.;
[short]               dark voice;
[WaitFor]           custom2 3;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your voice takes on a... sensual tone you think, making it feel, almost, dark and rich, and you like it. Still you have to get used to forcing the thing that lets you hiss stay completely open when you speak, or sigh, or otherwise breath out through your mouth.;
[status]               All in all, you're pretty happy with your new voice, if annoyed when you forget something and hiss something instead of speak something.;
[short]               rich, sensual voice, that occationally hisses,;
[WaitFor]           face 3;

[SHOULDERS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your shoulders aren't well defined, but like everything else, you consider them fairly average.;
[short]               average shoulders;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You're surprised to find your shoulders broaden a bit, and you have to rub them a bit to deal with the knots the change has given you.;
[status]               While a little broader, wider, then average your shoulders are still slightly thinner then your hips.;
[short]               pained, wider then average shoulders;
[WaitFor]           arms 2;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You shoulders don't widen any further, but they do gain a bit of muscle, and ironically this actually gets rid of the pain they had been giving you before.;
[status]               You're certain that your shoulders have gained strength.;
[short]               strong, lithe shoulders;
[WaitFor]           custom2 1;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               plain feet;
[short]               plain feet;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You wonder why the host has had the strange contraption behind you wheeled in, and you strapped in, till you realize it's to hold you upright as your feet have finally started merging together as well.;
[status]               You really aren't happy, being crippled by this game, soon even the money you'll win won't cover the medical costs fixing what it's done.;
[short]               slightly fused feet;
[WaitFor]           legs 3;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You look down and you watch as you confirm you can't wiggle your feet as much any more as they continue to fuse together.                                                                                                                                                                Still, the lack of pain is appreciated.;
[status]               While you can still tell apart your $LEGS$ and feet, they aren't too far from one undifferentiated mass of flesh.;
[short]               mostly fused feet;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You sigh as you watch your feet finally merge completely into an undifferentiated mass of flesh, though you can flick it about it's not really anything like moving feet.;
[status]               nonexistent;
[short]               nonexistent;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your mind is sharp and clear, and so you think you're ready for anything the game will throw at you.;
[short]               average mind;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You try not to blink/grimace as a rush of information/memory fills into your head, of a different but ultimately similar life. Considering the reputation of this show however, you're glad that this new set isn't overwriting your old life, though you're not sure you could pick out the differences between your old and new self without actually living as her for a while.;
[status]               Your mind is filled with the memories of two lives, thankfully, you think you can remember both without trouble.;
[short]               stuffed mind;
[WaitFor]           body 3;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your hands are actually smaller then average, and fairly thin, which gave you trouble when your mother insisted you learn the piano.;
[short]               small hands;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               As you watch, length, and strength, are added to your hands. You flex them a couple times and grin. Ha! Those black and white keys will bend to your will now!;
[status]               Your hands probably can easily play the piano now! Oh, and they're also strong enough to crush an unopened tin can as you find out by mistake when you and your opponent are given drinks during a break.;
[short]               strong, thin hands;
[WaitFor]           arms 2;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your hands widen a bit, not enough to lose any dexterity but enough that they go from thin to feminine.;
[status]               Your hands have taken on a more feminine cast, and you can't help but wonder about all these things about yourself that you just accepted, and how the game is removing them... at the cost of your humanity.;
[short]               feminine, strong hands;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You find the ends of your fingers strange, which is when you notice that your fingernails have all fallen off.
You never really painted your nails, not seeing the reason to do so despite your friends telling you that you should. ;
[status]               You've lost your fingernails and any chance to paint them... you're not really sad about it, just kind of disappointed by a lost chance.;
[short]               nailless strong, feminine hands;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You've been tapping idly on the podium for a bit, and when you started it was pretty quiet, but now you're actually making a tapping sound. You look and see some pretty long and sharp claws coming out from the ends of your fingers.;
[status]               On a closer look, the claws aren't coming out from the tip, like a cats, but from the palm side, and it feels like the way they're attached you're never going to cut yourself on them making a fist, they sheath every time you try.;
[short]               strong and feminine claws;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Black dress pants, the kind you normally wear to interviews, you just wish you had more then your $SHIRT$ for the show.;
[short]               black dress pants;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               A cold breeze up your legs almost makes you jump, you look down and see that your dress pants have developed slits up both sides of both legs, while you know these pants exist you never expected to wear a pair.;
[status]               Your glad that this show means you're mostly standing still, you're not sure you'd like showing off as much leg as these pants are probably wont to do.;
[short]               black dress pants with slit legs;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               This time you do start as the inside split of your pants opens up completely and your afraid you're about to give a free show when  you realize that you're not wearing pants anymore, but a knee length skirt with slits up each side.;
[status]               You have to wonder why the show changed your pants into a skirt, still, the show giving you a free make-over isn't the worst loss punishment.;
[short]               black side slit skirt;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               When you look down at yourself you aren't happy to find that your new skirt has gotten shorter, ending a good few inches above your knees.;
[status]               Your new short skirt is too short in your opinion, still it's not something you can do anything about till after the show is over.;
[short]               short black skirt;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Your eyes widen as it is very clear to you as to what has changed, or at least the most concerning part for you, as when your hand goes down to smooth out your short black skirt you find it's gotten shorter, combined with the fact that you're pretty sure you're going commando right now, the thought isn't encouraging.;
[status]               The cool stage air blowing across your nethers isn't what you wanted today, and thus is all the more incentive to win. While longer then a mini skirt, it isn't much longer.;
[short]               very short black slit skirt;

[GROIN];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               hidden;
[short]               average human pussy;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You feel a pinch, and reach down under your $PANTS$ to adjust things, and realize you can't immediately feel your pussy. However, before you can panic, you find it, hidden in a slit in your $CUSTOM1$;
[status]               Your pussy is hidden, both under your $PANTS$ and your new genital slit, and considering you're starting to look like a snake you suppose you should be glad you don't have a cloaca.;
[short]               hidden pussy;
[WaitFor]           waist 1;

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your body is average for someone your age.;
[short]               average torso;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               As you watch your bare midriff tones up, thinning slightly as you lose some of that body fat.;
[status]               While now more toned then average, your midriff remains pretty average.;
[short]               toned average torso;
[WaitFor]           shirt 4;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You slim down a bit more, giving your midriff and torso a more lithe form. It's a change you could probably come to enjoy, if other changes didn't come with it.;
[status]               Your torso, while not sporting a sixpack of abs, feels, to you at least, stronger.;
[short]               lithe toned torso;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               When you don't see an obvious change, and check your $HAIR$ and find it unchanged you look down and find something surprising, your belly button is gone, though there is still a small divot where it was the button itself is just gone.;
[status]               It's strange to no longer have something that was always there before, though that doesn't just apply to your belly button.;
[short]               smooth, lithe, and toned torso;

[SHOES];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Black dress shoes with black socks, combined with your $PANTS$ it'd make for a decent ensemble, if not for your $SHIRT$;
[short]               black dress shoes and socks;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You frown as your feet, no, your shoes feel strange, it takes a look but you realize you no longer have socks.;
[status]               Your black dress shoes aren't really that comfortable without socks, and probably will smell bad later if you can't correct that fact soon.;
[short]               uncomfortable black dress shoes;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               The uncomfortable nature of your dress shoes is gone, thankfully not because they are gone, but they've definitely been changed, they now are closer to fancy slippers then dress shoes.;
[status]               You wiggle your toes a bit in your new footwear, they certainly more comfortable, but at the same time you aren't look forward to buying a new pair of dress shoes.;
[short]               black fancy slippers;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You can easily tell that your shoes have changed again, now they look, and feel, more like sandals.;
[status]               While still completely black, you have to wonder why the game has turned your shoes into sandals.;
[short]               black sandals;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You don't have to look down to know what happened, your 'sandals' are gone, you are barefoot.;
[status]               You have to wonder why the game bothered with all those changes if it was just going to take them away completely in the end.;
[short]               nonexistent;

[BREASTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your B-cup breasts, though on the larger side of the scale, are usually not your most defining feature.;
[short]               B-cup breasts;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               For the first time, your loss seems to bring a 'beneficial' change, or perhaps bountiful would be the better word, as you suppress a smirk as your breasts gain another size.;
[status]               Your new C-cup breasts sit comfortably in your $SHIRT$, so you suspect it's changed a bit as well, as it's giving more support then your store bought bras ever did, at least, it feels like it.;
[short]               C-cup breasts;
[WaitFor]           shirt 4;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Something about your nipples is off, taking a chance you take a peek and your eyes widen in surprise, it looks like your nipples are gone, but you're sure you can still feel them.                                                                     
You finally solve the mystery of your nipples as you run one hand over a breast, they're recessed into pockets you discover as one engorges and seemingly appears from a near invisible slit in your $CUSTOM1$.;
[status]               To keep from being distracted you cease touching your breasts, and your nipple quickly disappears into it's pocket, it's so bizarre, still, at least you don't need to constantly worry about tenting.;
[short]               C-cup breasts;

[HAIR];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your hair, not you most attractive feature, a mousy brown with split ends that reaches your $SHOULDERS$. There are days you wish you didn't have to deal with it.;
[short]               mousy brown messy shoulder length hair;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You wait for your transformation, but feel nothing. It's kind of disturbing actually, till you realize in looking around you no longer feel your hair brushing your $SHOULDERS$.;
[status]               Your hair is getting shorter, but thankfully it isn't shedding, you're not sure what you'd do if that was happening.;
[short]               shorter messy brown hair;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               When something else obvious doesn't change, you check your hair again, and again it's shortened. While it'll be easier to deal with like this, you have to wonder just how short it's going to get.;
[status]               Your hair now reaches the top of your neck, it hasn't changed colour, nor has it turned to snakes or anything else like that, though you really aren't going to complain about the free hair cut, yet.;
[short]               neck length messy hair;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Again no obvious change, and again you find your hair shorter. While you wanted more easily dealt with hair, you also don't want it to be so short.;
[status]               Your starting to get concerned that you're going to end up with a boy cut at this rate, it's a little annoying but not enough to get your head out of the game.;
[short]               short cropped messy hair;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You want to groan as again there isn't an obvious change, reaching up you feel that your hair has shortened by at least and inch again.;
[status]               It's frustrating but you know that if you lose much more you'll probably end up with a buzz cut.;
[short]               very short messy hair;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You frown as the buzzer sounds again, you look down, see no changes then reach up to your head and find your earlier prediction correct, you've got a buzz cut.;
[status]               Taking a longer look, your new buzz cut thankfully doesn't look too much like a guys but it being so short does not bring a smile to your face.;
[short]               buzz cut hair;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Another loss, and another change that isn't obvious and you have to fight the urge not to scream in frustration as your hair has shortened to the point that it looks like you've shaved your hair.;
[status]               Your hair is still there, kind of, in that you have hair follicles and hair is growing from them, but it's so short it looks like you've shaved your head recently, you don't want to think about what would happen if it gets much worse.;
[short]               shaved hair;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               Your eyes widen as you've lost again, and nothing obvious has changed, every time that's happened before...     When you reach up you can only feel your $CUSTOM1$, you're bald.;
[status]               You sigh as you feel you're bald head again, it'll take a while for you to get used to that.;
[short]               bald;

[FACE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your face is plain, and you'll admit that when asked.;
[short]               plain face;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You jolt as you realize that you can't smell anything anymore, and feeling your face you find that you don't have a nose anymore, but when you open your mouth, whether to complain, scream or whatever it was you were going to do, you find you can smell again, at least until you close your mouth again.

It seems your 'nose' is now where a human's hard palate is... you really hope you won't have to keep your mouth open to smell.;
[status]               You're surprised to find yourself breathing through a nose that isn't there, and reaching up you confirm you still have nostrils.;
[short]               noseless flat face;
[WaitFor]           custom2 4;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               It's near the end of the day and so, as anyone would, you yawn, only to find, with a little cracking, that your mouth widens much further then you'd expect. ;
[status]               You feel your jaw and it feels like it's connected further back, your convinced the structure of your jaw and skull is changing.;
[short]               flat face and long jaw;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You get a slight headache for a moment as the structure of your face changes greatly, and when you go to roll your jaw to get used to the changes you find the left and right sides of it moving independently, feeling around you are sure you have the head of a snake, though obviously it's not affected your intelligence.;
[status]               Carefully, you feel around inside your new mouth, your tongue is a snake's , but your jaws are not quite a snake's. You have the two, definitely venomous fangs the fold down from the top of your mouth, but have a lot more teeth then you'd expect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      With the first four teeth on each bottom jaw being fangs that curve back, closer together then normal for a snake but wider then with a human, that transistion into human molars... and you have your wisdom teeth back, but your new larger jaw hopefully means they won't be problems.;
[short]               human sized King Cobra head with mixed dentition;

[SHIRT];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your black tank top, rather plain but serviceable.;
[short]               plain black tank top;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You blink as you feel something shift, when you think no-one's looking you check under your tank top and confirm, your bra is gone.;
[status]               Your breasts are sagging a bit under your shirt, seeing as your bra is gone.;
[short]               black tank top, without support,;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your first warning that something has changed is a breeze across your stomach, your tank top has shortened by a couple inches.;
[status]               You tank top no longer covers your midriff, it's not something you enjoy.;
[short]               short, nonsupporting, black tank top;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               As your tank top shortens, it also tightens up, now at least your breasts have support again.                               Your tank top is closer to a tube top now, at least it's providing you some support now.                                        Actually, it IS a tube top, you've been so focused on your midriff that you didn't notice the shoulders disappearing.;
[status]               You wouldn't normally wear a short tube top, but you suppose you could get used to it.;
[short]               black tube top;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Your tube top shrinks again, tightens again, and starts providing more support, again, as half of it seems to, twist. Your black tube top has become a twist top.;
[status]               This black twist top is more revealing then anything you've worn outside your bedroom, but you ignore that to keep from being distracted.;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You feel something strange under your $PANTS$, though you don't dare look.

You bend down, towards the audience, to pick up something, a ball, someone's thrown onto the stage when you realize that you can't spread your legs quite as far apart as normal.;
[status]               It's very strange, but with the game on-going you can't spare much thought for your legs so long as you can still stand.;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You go to adjust your stance and it's almost painful, as if you're stretching, or pinching, the insides of both legs down to your knees. When you look down you have to stifle a scream, your legs are fusing together!;
[status]               You take a few deep breaths to calm yourself, and refocus on the game, with the money you'll win you can fix this.;
[short]               partially fused legs;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               It almost like you're wearing a sleeping bag or burlap sack, and you don't know need to look down to know why, the skin and flesh between your legs has completely fused.;
[status]               You don't want to know what you're becoming, mostly because you do know that each change from this point forwards means less money you can keep from winning.;
[short]               fused human legs;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               The last of what let you tell the right leg from your left disappears as your legs complete their transformation into a single mass, it's almost like they're becoming a tail of some sort... you really hope not a fish tail.;

[short]               nonexistent;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You can feel the regrowth of bones in the $LEGS$ that was your legs, and with it more control over it. It's definitely becoming a tail of some sort, but, when you feel it, are those ribs?;
[status]               Your legs and feet have turned into a large, fat, tail, you think.;
[short]               large fat tail;
[WaitFor]           legs 4;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You watch as your new tail, and now it's definitely a tail, grows a couple feet, you go to unhook yourself from the machine holding you up but the host stops you, apparently it's not full grown yet.;
[status]               Coupled with your $CUSTOM1$, you're certain you're developing the tail, okay body, of a snake below your $WAIST$.;
[short]               short fat snake tail;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your snake body like tail grows again, and you can feel every inch. While you know your $GROIN$ hasn't changed position, sitting snugly under your $PANTS$, you think you can see the hidden slit that now hides your anus much further down.;
[status]               Your snake body like, not counting the part that was your legs, is about as long as your legs were, and apparently is still not long enough to properly support you.             Considering human feet have nowhere near as large a footprint, that seems highly annoying.;
[short]               6' long snake body tail;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               It's kind of boring, just watching your tail grow, though at least you can use it to show some of your agitation, letting the end of it twitch side to side.;
[status]               The increased length is interesting in the feelings it gives you, but is otherwise utterly boring, though boredom may be better then dwelling on the terror of having a ruined life.;
[short]               9' foot snake body tail;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               As you bring your again lengthened snake body tail into a coil beneath you the host finally helps get you out of the contraption that was holding you up, though he warns you that you're still not done growing.

;
[status]               Even if you aren't done 'finished growing' you intend to stop growing and win the game, big enough will have to be big enough.;
[short]               coiled 12' snake body tail;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               With a sigh, you acknowledge the final increase in the length of your new snake body tail by carefully recoiling yourself into a comfortable position.

This is, of course, after a little grandstanding by the host where he measures you out, from waist to the tip of your tail's tail, it's at least 15' in length, though usually only 12' rests on the ground when you're getting around.;
[status]               Ignoring it effectively doubling or tripling your weight, the shear length of your new snake body tail is going to make sharing an elevator fairly interesting, though you shouldn't take up much more room in your daily life, so long as you remember to coil up.;

[tf]               You rub your skin as it, across your whole body, seems to start to dry out.;
[status]               Strangely you dry skin isn't making you wish for lotion or water, yet you'd think it would.;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your skin continues to dry, some places are worse then others, and in irritation caused by the itchiness, you scratch one such place on one of your $ARMS$, only to find it peeling off to reveal black and a pale yellow.;
[status]               Your skin is peeling in places with scales beneath, considering the other changes you're going through, this is, in retrospect, not surprising at all.;
[short]               peeling dry skin with scales beneath;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               More skin is ready to peel off, and you oblige, this time revealing that the scales that go down your front are almost uniformly a pale yellow in colour.;
[status]               You now know what it feels like for a snake to shed it's skin, and why they try to do so quickly.;
[short]               peeling skin with scale patches;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You get most of the dry dead skin off, revealing how your back, $CUSTOM3$, $ARMS$, and the top of your head are covered with black scales, with yellow to pale yellow bands.;
[status]               Of the scales you can get to, you are surprised that your scales are very smooth, then again you never felt snake scales before.;
[short]               black scaled with pale yellow belly and bands, and patches of skin;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You're finally free of the last of that dead skin, and you have to admit, your new skin is at the least, pretty, though hopefully beautiful is a closer description.;
[status]               Your scales are fairly fine over most of your body, but are larger in some places.;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You can feel, not just see, there being changes in the bones of your waist and hips that is just disturbing to feel.;
[status]               Your waist thinned a bit and hips have gained a slight flare, but you know internally they've changed significantly.;

[WaitFor]           feet 3;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your waist thins very slightly as you feel more changes within your hips, you can feel your bones changing and you are certain that if you got an X-ray now that, internally, they would not look remotely human.;
[status]               Externally, your waist and hips look wider than normal, or would without the $LEGS$ you have currently dangling beneath.;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               As you watch, your arms tone up a bit, which is cool, if you didn't feel the need to now keep them that toned and actually go to the gym.;
[status]               Your arms have toned up, making it look like you regularly go to the gym, something you may actually need or want to do now.;
[short]               toned teen arms;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your arms seem to gain a little length, some more muscle, and somehow appear more feminine then they did before. It's actually interesting to watch it happen since despite being average you thought they were feminine.;
[status]               Your arms are longer, stronger, and somehow even more feminine, it's actually pretty cool if strange.;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There's a crick in your neck and you lean forward a bit to relieve it, but, your not actually leaning forward, it's just your neck moving forward, growing a bit in length. You almost snap it back in surprise and how disconcerting it initially felt.;
[status]               Reaching up, you try to feel how much longer your neck is, only to realize you've never actually felt up your neck before to figure out it's length, making it a pretty pointless endeavour.;

[WaitFor]           shoulders 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               This time, as you feel your neck gain more length you feel something else as well, and in the surprise of this your hood extends, yes, hood, like a viper's, only not that big, you'd think it's about an inch in size right now, and for some reason that feels kind of embarrassing.;
[status]               You're glad when you can retract your, well, infantile hood, so close to the end of the game you're almost ready to lose more, just to have your hood reach a decent size.;
[short]               half foot neck with infantile hood;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You stretch your neck, waving side to side, as it increases in it's size in general. Out of curiosity, you try to extend your hood again and are happy to see it's grown, not as much as you'd like but you don't feel like it's something you'd see on a kid anymore.;
[status]               You still feel your hood is kind of undeveloped but acceptable, and when not distracted by that you quickly are surprised at just how flexible your new neck actually is. You find you tend to keep your head at about the height it used to sit at, so you're surprised to find you sometimes are forgetting you have such a long neck.;
[short]               under a foot long neck with underdeveloped hood;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You readjust as you think your neck reaches it's final length, width, and depth. Your hood, you're pleased to find, is just the right size. It's smaller then what you'd expect to see on a naga, but you KNOW it's just the right size.;
[status]               At a foot in length, you could easily use your neck to add a foot of height to your height when you're 'Standing' though compared to your full length it's probably not that long. Your hood, when fully extended, is about a foot across at it's widest, smaller then a naga's if it was based on a Viper, but since you're sure you're closer to a King Cobra it's just perfect.;

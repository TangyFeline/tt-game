[Desc]               <blue>In walks Doug Wallstone. The perfect contestant. 28, but looks like he's 20. Strong and muscular legs that look like they could win a marathon (and indeed they have). And an almost encyclopedic knowledge of Transformania Time. You've been in the audience since the beginning with Dave Muster, now Dana, and whether in the stands or on the couch at home, you've never missed an episode. So when Clarke (yeah, you're on a first name basis) offered you a spot for the next match, you jumped at the opportunity. The crowd knows you're going to win. Your opponent knows you're going to win. You know you're going to win. Let's get started.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>The game is over, and even though you lost, you couldn't really care less. You shake the hand of your beaming opponent and skip off before the host is even done congratulating the victor. The rest of your life remains the same as you believe it always was: some exercises in the morning, waitressing in the afternoon, reading your book in the evening. Nothing seems to have changed for you, and even if your former self would collapse under the monotony, you like your 'new' life just the way it is.</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have a loud and proud voice, and you're not afraid to show it. Sure, it raises a bit too much when you're frightened, but you kinda like not having a low, dull voice.;
[short]               loud voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There's a bunch of strange vibrations in your throat, and you know that this must be your voice changing. As you test out your new voice, however, it sounds exactly the same. It takes some time before you learn the true change. Your voice has gotten quieter, and you can't seem to raise your voice above a certain volume.;
[status]               Your voice has lowered in volume, and there's a cap to how loud you talk.;
[short]               quieter voice;
[tgShade]            voice 25;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your voice cracks in the middle of a sentence as your voice raises an octave. It's thankfully not a girl's voice, but it reminds you of that horrible squeaky voice you had in your teens. Time to take things seriously.;
[status]               You have a voice that reminds you of a pubescant boy's.;
[short]               boyish voice;
[tgShade]            voice 50;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your voice cracks yet again as you're in the middle of a conversation with the host, but this time you keep your mouth shut. You don't know if you're doing it to fool the crowd or yourself, but you already know your voice has gotten much higher, even from the inflections you have when thinking. Did it change your mind too??;
[status]               You have a girl's voice, and you're compensating for it by keeping your mouth closed.;
[short]               high and girly voice;
[tgShade]            voice 75;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Gradually, you've been getting more and more talkative, striking up more and more conversations with the host (he actually grows tomatoes in his spare time!) In the middle of one of them, you hear a lisp start to creep up in your voice, and you almost falter before the host keeps up the discussion. Stupid buckteeth.;
[status]               You have a slight lisp in your soothing voice from your buckteeth. This is actually something about you that you've never seemed to mind for some reason. ;
[short]               high voice with a slight lisp;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[WaitFor]           face 4;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You mull some things over in your head while waiting for the next round. Rich, handsome, fit. Why did you come to a show that near guarantees change when you're already perfect? Well, aside from being a huge fan of the show and knowing all the games inside and out, you just... know you're gonna win it. And not like those guys that say "there's no way I'll lose" and then lose comically, you know for a fact that you'll win. You've seen every show. You know every game. It's not like you'll win without losing a round (although that is a thought that has come in your head every now and then), but you know the game too much to lose. ;
[short]               confident and cocky mind;
[tgShade]            mind 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               After a couple of losses, and this recent one, you find yourself getting a bit nervous. Granted, you never expected to win flawlessly, but the number of rounds you've lost is starting to get you down. What worries you even more is how you don't see any changes after your latest loss, which could only mean that it's currently changing your mind. But you don't recognise any changes... or is that just your mind fully accepting them?;
[status]               You are a bit more unsure of yourself, and you don't know if that's because of all the rounds you've lost, or changes to your mind.;
[short]               befuddled mind;
[tgShade]            mind 16;
[WaitFor]           waist 1;
[WaitFor]           face 1;
[WaitFor]           butt 1;
[WaitFor]           shoes 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Maybe this is that 'refractory period' thing, but you're really starting to get down from all the losses. There was somewhere, in the far far back of your mind, a strategy for if you ever got in the position that you're in now, constantly losing rounds. Whatever that strategy was, it's gone right out the window. You're now coping with the thought that you might not take this game, and it's sending you into a spiral of self-doubt, so much so that you don't realize that this is all a byproduct of the increasing mental changes.;
[status]               You are worried about the outcome of the game, and are nowhere near as confident as you once were.;
[short]               scared mind;
[tgShade]            mind 33;
[WaitFor]           groin 1;
[WaitFor]           hair 2;
[WaitFor]           body 1;
[WaitFor]           waist 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               The constant losses are far from your mind now, as well as mostly all the thoughts you had coming into the game. Now you are thinking about your future. All your life you've thought yourself as being the best, winning anything you ever try, but now you're losing everything, and you feel like bursting into tears. The thought that these feelings are caused by the changes to your mind doesn't even cross it, and instead you are busy contemplating your life.;
[status]               Your mind has changed dramatically from cocky bravado to timid wallflower.;
[short]               timid mind;
[tgShade]            mind 50;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               It seems like a mental block has been lifted from your mind, and you feel an immediate rush of calm. Who cares if you keep losing? So long as you're having fun with the game, it doesn't matter who wins, right? Satisfied with your thinking, you loosen up, not noticing as you hips cock to the side in a distinctly unmasculine way...;
[status]               Having been given a new rush of confidence, you don't notice how effiminate your mind is becoming.;
[short]               calmer, slightly feminine mind;
[tgShade]            mind 66;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               The shrinking of your $GROIN$ is only escalating your mental changes further. You know that the game's changing your mind, you know that there are elements of your former life (no, current life!) that you're forgetting, you know that the game won't rest until it makes you a weak and girly female. And yet, you don't care. You can't even remember why you don't care. Furthermore, with every detail about your life you lose, a new fact takes its place, like how you grew up on a farm with your siblings before moving to the city, and how you just recently became confident enough to wear a bikini at the beach. The more knowledge that escapes your mind, the easier it is to just ignore it, and focus on the new you. The calm you. The woman you.;
[status]               Your mind is now one of a woman's, and you don't care in the slightest.;
[short]               feminine mind;
[tgShade]            mind 83;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               There's a moment of finality to your mind, but you can't really figure out why. All you know is that nothing has changed since you entered the competition. You're still the friendly and introverted bunny girl that you started off as, and go over some basic facts in your head before making the conclusion that nope, nothing's changed. Although you remember that this game comes with mental changes, right? Hopefully not. They sound scary.;
[status]               You are Sammy Twillkey, an approachable, but still shy, bunny girl. After a cruel bet with a sort of acquaintance/frenemy of yours, you have wound up competing in a game show that you know next to nothing about, but it looks like you're winning. Hopefully it ends soon so you can go back to cuddling up next to your fireplace with a good book.;
[short]               serene and shy bunny girl mind;
[tgShade]            mind 100;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have pretty big feet. You used to have a problem with your gait because of them, but running seems to have sorted it out.;
[short]               large feet;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You get a weird itching in one foot, before it jumps to another. Seems like your feet have changed this time around, but so long as it doesn't interfere with your running (and as of right now, it doesn't feel like it), you couldn't care less. You don't even bother to take off your $SHOES$ to see the change, instead acting as if no change ever occurred. ;
[status]               Your feet have changed in some way, but it doesn't bother you.;
[short]               possibly large feet;
[tgShade]            feet 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your $SHOES$ are starting to get too loose to properly stay on your feet, so you finally take them off to check the changes. As you expected, your feet have dramatically diminished in size, and though they still fit in your shoes for now, you know that a couple of more losses will change that.;
[status]               Now that you've properly looked at your feet, you know for certain that they are nowhere near as big as they were entering the game.;
[short]               small feet;
[tgShade]            feet 66;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Is there a rock in your shoe? Probably not, as the pressure you're feeling is in both of them. You remove your $SHOES$ to get a closer look, and are just reminded of how big your feet are for a girl, and that you should buy some polish.;
[status]               You have big feet. No getting around it. Your last boyfriend said they were fine, but you know he was just being nice. Any bigger and they would look like a guy's. While thinking about them, you get an idea of going to a pedicurist to get your toes done like your $HANDS$, but that would mean showing them your feet... That's it. No more thoughts about your feet. It's just getting you down.;
[short]               slightly big feet;
[tgShade]            feet 100;
[WaitFor]           hands 3;
[WaitFor]           mind 5;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You've never liked your hands. Your fingers are too short and thick, and the hands themselves are covered in calluses, despite them not really seeing any hard work. Hopefully they're the first to change if you lose.;
[short]               callused hands with short stubby fingers;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               First you're reeling at the loss of a round, and next thing you know your hands are smooth and callus free. It sort of weakens the blow of losing the round. Sort of.;
[status]               Your hands tout smoother skin, but otherwise nothing has changed about them.;
[short]               smooth hands with short stubby fingers;
[tgShade]            hands 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your fingers start to lengthen and thin, giving you pianist fingers. If you didn't know that they won't stop changing until they're girly, you'd be thankful for the change. As of now, though, you're pretty scared. ;
[status]               Your hands have long and limber fingers.;
[short]               slim and thin hands;
[tgShade]            hands 66;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Any imperfections on your hands get washed away as they become tiny and delicate. Your nails grow out a bit, covered in shiny polish.;
[status]               Your hands are pretty and small, with fingernails that are shiny from polish. You're not usually a nail polish girl, but you've done them up for the occasion.;
[short]               slim and fragile hands with long fingernails;
[tgShade]            hands 100;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You've invested in a pair of tearaway shorts that cost a fortune, but at least you'll be prepared for anything that happens under it.;
[short]               tearaway shorts;
[tgShade]            pants 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There's a weird tightness to your shorts (no, not in THAT way...) that makes the previously loose-fitting tearaway shorts feel like regular old shorts. On one hand, you're glad that the change only focused on such a trivial part of you, but those shorts were really expensive...;
[status]               Your once tearaway shorts are now no different than the countless pairs of jogging shorts you own.;
[short]               regular shorts;
[tgShade]            pants 25;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your shorts suddenly get loose again, and for a moment you get a hopeful feeling that you've regained your tearaway shorts. Not the case, as they have lightened in colour and lengthened to just above your knees, with a piece of fabric at the front in a skirtlike format. You think it's called a skort, and the name doesn't help how humiliating it is.;
[status]               Your shorts have lengthened and paled, while also getting looser.;
[short]               baggy, cream skort;
[tgShade]            pants 50;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your 'skort' completes its transition to a proper skirt, darkening to a tan while shortening to halfway up your thigh. That isn't all that changes, as you feel a pinch in your $BUTT$ like you've been given a wedgie, your underwear now an all too comfortable pair of panties. You don't know what scare you more, how many rounds you're losing, or how good your new panties feel on your $GROIN$...;
[status]               You have on a normal looking tan skirt with a soft pair of panties.;
[short]               tan skirt with panties;
[tgShade]            pants 75;
[WaitFor]           butt 2;
[WaitFor]           groin 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Your skirt gains a couple of frills, raising up closer to your $GROIN$ (thankfully not enough to be lewd) and changing to a pleasant blue tone. You can't help but twirl in it, appreciating the 'swoosh' it gives.;
[status]               You have on a pastel blue rah-rah, that shows off a bit too much of your $LEGS$ for you to feel completely comfortable with, but it looks too good on you to let by. ;
[short]               light blue rah-rah skirt;
[tgShade]            pants 100;

[GROIN];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You've got a monster sleeping in your $PANTS$. Seven inches. He's seen a lot of action, too. Maybe not recently... but you intend for him to see a lot more after this show ends.;
[short]               hairy and powerful 7 inch dong;
[tgShade]            groin 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You were waiting for this. Your dick grows erect, and you know for a fact that it was caused in game. Immediately, and shamelessly, you drop your $PANTS$ and jerk it, finishing in quite a fast time. The audience gasps and scoffs, but all the previous contestants do it, right? Why not start early?;
[status]               You have a firm erection that makes a nice dent in your $PANTS$, the fruits of which can be seen on the floor next to you. Hey, so long as you still have it...;
[short]               erect cock;
[tgShade]            groin 16;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               A feeling of euphoria washes over you, followed shortly after by a feeling of stickiness. You don't have to look down at your $PANTS$ to see what's transpired, and you already feel a looseness in them. Still, you attempt to keep your cool, grinning as if there were no changes at all. You're not sure if you're fooling anyone, but you don't care. ;
[status]               Your dick has lost an inch or two, and it's a race against time now before it vanishes completely.;
[short]               smaller dick;
[tgShade]            groin 33;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You're starting to get worried about what's going on under your $PANTS$. Not just that you're turning into a girl, that's a given. Rather, you're worried about how arousing it... isn't. With every losing contestant you've seen (and you've seen all of them) the changing of their genitalia is always a source of great arousal, and helps escalate their mental changes. The only time you can think of that was different was that centaur back in 2011, and that was a vagina into a dick. Plus... you were kinda looking forward to the horniness, at least it would give you a consolation prize for all the losing you're doing.;
[status]               Your dick is now less than half of its original size, but you're not feeling any of the expected arousal from it.;
[short]               3 inch penis;
[tgShade]            groin 50;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               As another change pushes your dick inwards, you decide that enough is enough. If you're gonna keep losing these rounds, you should at least have some fun with it before it's gone. You're about to strip your $PANTS$ and have one swan song of a fap, before the eyes of the audience and the cameras burrow into you. Try as you might, you can't manage to get yourself to do it. Even as it disappears from your grasp, you find yourself too self-concious to seize the ever fleeting moment. You lost your virginity in a dressing booth! What's happening to you?!;
[status]               Your dick is now around the size of your balls, and yet you still can't build up the courage to masturbate.;
[short]               2 inch microdick;
[tgShade]            groin 66;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You get a strange new sensation as your penis continues to shrink, taking your balls with it. Serenity. You've somehow forgotten why you were so worried about it shrinking, even though you know that you were once very, very worried. In fact, as you take a careful peak down at your crotch, it looks more and more out of place. It certainly doesn't fit in with your $BUTT$ and $LEGS$, and they've been ok changes so far, so...;
[status]               Your penis is now just a tiny ball-less nub, and you're finding it harder and harder to care.;
[short]               ball-less clitty;

[tgShade]            groin 83;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               You double over with a feeling of pleasure as an odd sucking sensation occurs around your privates, along with some stomach cramps. You don't dare remove your $PANTS$ to check what happened, but your vagina feels as normal as ever. Still, you hope nobody saw your arousal...;
[status]               You have a normal vagina, your hymen still intact. You've made a promise to yourself that you would only lose your virginity to the right man, and unfortunately, he hasn't arrived yet. That doesn't matter though. Relationships don't hinge around sex, anyway, and even though you get periods of manic heat from your rabbit qualities, you pride yourself on it not controlling your life.;

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have a lithe and agile 5'8 body. Not the tallest guy around, but you can run circles around anyone who questions it. Your skin has a nice healthy tan from all your time on the track.;
[short]               healthy 5'8 body;
[tgShade]            body 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There's a shooting pain that inflicts your whole body, and even though you're unfamiliar with it, you know exactly what will change next. Sure enough, you look in the mirror and measure yourself with a measuring tape you brought for this very occasion, and see that you've lost an inch. Other than that, no other changes, except for your skin looking just a tiny bit paler. Maybe this is a grace period of sorts before the real changes begin. Too bad you won't be seeing them.;
[status]               You have a 5'7 body, having lost an inch from a change, and your skin's tan has faded a little bit.;
[short]               5'7, slightly tanned body;
[tgShade]            body 25;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Another inch is lost from your body, but you already feel more effects. Even though you feel younger, you also feel weaker, more inadequate. This won't help your $MIND$ out any. ;
[status]               You have a weaker, shorter body that's giving you more trouble than you'd like to admit.;
[short]               weaker, 5'6 body;
[tgShade]            body 50;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You shrink yet another inch while your very bone structure begins to change. Your $ARMS$ and $LEGS$ get shorter, your pelvis juts out, and your shoulders pull themselves in. These changes aren't what bother you, though. What bothers you is that you never noticed the changes until the host tells you about them.;
[status]               You now have an average female body.;
[short]               5'5 female body;
[tgShade]            body 75;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;

[tf]               Your height remains the same, but other sections of your body start to shift. Your skin grows pale white, your pelvis elongates noticeably (thanks for that, mom) and you get a rush of energy that indicates to your $MIND$ that your daily workouts are paying off.;
[status]               You have a pretty fit body, and aside from fantasies about being a little taller, you quite like it. Well, except your skin, which never seems to get a tan no matter how long you sunbathe. You hop (ha ha...) on your toes, keeping the blood pumping for the game.;

There's a light coating of hair on your chest that you've always been proud of, mostly because you grew it before any of your friends.;

[tf]               The front of your $SHIRT$ feels looser, and you clutch your chest to feel a soft, slim surface replacing what you had of pecs. Lifting up your shirt, you immediately pull it back down as you see your nipples have doubled in size. It's not a pair of breasts, but you already feel emasculated. ;

All the chatter from the audience, every bored squeak of a shoe, every uncomfortable cough assaults your already addled mind, which takes the information and just rolls with it, removing anything conflicting to your position. By the time you've calmed down, you've always had the tall yellow furred rabbit ears that stick up from your head.;

You've never been told where you got your rabbit traits from, all you've heard are tales of an unusually frisky great grandfather that you're certain is just a dirty urban legend. Still, at least you didn't inherit furry legs from your grandmother.;

[tf]               Your face shudders a bit as a wave of change approaches it. Fearing the worst, you turn to that mirror that you've always dreamt of using to see... minimal changes, if not nonexistent. Gazing at your image reveals small dissimilarities, like a slightly smaller nose or slightly bigger eyes, but that's all they are. Slight. You puff out your $BREASTS$, thrilled that even when you lose, you win in the end.;
[status]               Your face has changed, but not by a lot, with only small features being enhanced. You recognise this as the section of changes that lure a loser into a false sense of security, but you're no loser.;

[tf]               Now the facial changes get more severe. Your nose gets stuffy as it shrinks into your face, your already soft chin gets more subdued, and your eyes become a warm and inviting blue. As it stands now, your face could either belong to a man or a woman.;

[tf]               Nothing about you seems to have changed, until you look in the mirror and can't recognise yourself. Your face has rounded out even more, giving off an almost chubby appearance, and your eyelashes have grown out significantly. It's not a purely sexual look, but definitely cute, maybe a girl-next-door look that could be better pulled off with some light blush, and before you know it you've spent five minutes contemplating your new face.;

You are growing breasts, and you are turning into a girl. You fidget with it as the straps uncomfortably jut into your shoulders. How do you girls survive with this? Wait... "you girls"?;

You already know that your daily sprints are futile. After a couple of minutes in shock and despair, you raise up with your chin held high. This was a warning sign to stop losing rounds. You can do this.;

[tf]               As more and more fat starts to pool around your thighs and calves, making them more and more feminine, you find it harder and harder to ignore the changes. What if you aren't able to run again? Even if you win and reverse the changes, what will your trackmates say about your current legs? You keep going down a spiral of worry as your thoughts stray from your legs and latch onto your very being.;

You pull your $SHIRT$ over it and face your opponent again with a determined face.;

It has slimmed down even more, with the sides pinched in slightly. There's no doubt now, you have the waist of a woman.;

Looking at it in the mirror reveals no size difference, but it's clearly not as fit as it once was.;

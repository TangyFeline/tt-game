[Desc]               <pink>Caroline is a forty-five year old woman who is, to be fully honest, a little bit past her prime.  Back in the late 80s and early 90s she was in a lot of TV commercials and fashion shows, but sadly time hasn't been terribly kind to her and her age has been showing.  At five foot five inches and a middle-aged body, Caroline wears a designer dress that was in fashion about a decade ago, but since her pay hasn't been quite what is used to be for the past fifteen years she isn't quite at the top of the beauty world anymore.  She has declared bankruptcy several times in the past few years, but you aren't quite sure if she is here at this gameshow for a second shot at fame or the prize money.</pink>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>Caroline is completely frozen in her new plastic body, a sexy large-breasted and curvaceous mannequin, eternally locked in a sexy pose with her hands resting on her hips.  She gazes out at you and the rest of the audience with a smug, content look on her inanimate plastic face.  She wears her expensive, sexy tight silver dress and jewelry proudly, an icon of wealth and beauty that will never age nor fall out of style ever again.  As two technicians lift her onto a dolly and wheel her away, you can almost sense Caroline still beaming with pride and vanity... she as spent the past twenty years yearning for the days of her youth and glory and only now can she reclaim them:  forever young, forever beautiful, forever famous!</pink>;

[SHOES];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Caroline is wearing a pair of one and a half inch, leopord-pattern high heels on her feet.  Twenty years ago it was one of her defining characteristics when she'd strut her stuff out on the catwalk.  Now, though, it just looks quite dated and tacky.;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               The dark spots from the leopord pattern on Caroline's high heels begin to grow in diameter until they have all but drowned out the leapord pattern, instead leaving them a more fashionable solid black.  Caroline stumbles a little as the heels extend from one and a half inches to two.;
[status]               Caroline is wearing a pair of two inch solid black high heels.;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               The underside to Caroline's black high heels turns to a bright pink.  At first glance the bright pink against the black seems a little distasteful if you know anything about fashion, but after examining them a bit further you realize that it sort of works in an edgy kind of way.  The heels also grow even taller to two and a half inches.;
[status]               Caroline is wearing a pair of two-and-a-half-inch pair of black and pink high heels.  Although edgy, she pulls the look off surprisingly well!;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Caroline gaps a little in her $VOICE$ and nearly topples over as her heels grow out to three inches tall.  Not only that, but the heels take on a shine and distinctive, sleek look.  Obviously they are custom-made by a rather prestigious designer, and she is wearing the only pair in existence.  Caroline beams--it has been a long time since she has been so honored, and they truly do show off her $LEGS$.;
[status]               Caroline is wearing a pair of three inch black-and-pink designer heels that emphasizes the calves on her $LEGS$, the only heels its kind and she is wearing them, not you or anybody else!  She seems to take care to stand still to avoid the risk of breaking a heel to make them last as long as possible, even if it means not moving ever again...;

[FACE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               As much as Caroline would like to fend off the inevitable ravage of time, her face possesses a fair number of wrinkles that can only be concealed so much underneath her makeup before she begins to look creepy and desperate.  Which, sadly, she kind of does.;

[tgShade]            face 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Caroline's face seems to spasm.  She blinks rapidly and gasps slightly in her $VOICE$, but to her glee the net effect seems to be that some of the tired wrinkles around her eyes and cheeks have smoothed out, not due to the overapplication of cosmetics and creams but simply by the virtue of youth.  She hums happily, admiring herself in the mirror.;
[status]               Caroline's face has a few wrinkles, although she generally looks a good deal younger than before with fewer age-imposed creases. ;

[tgShade]            face 16;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Caroline blinks a few times and runs the fingers on her $HANDS$ over the countour of her face.  She smiles, noticing that the last of her wrinkles have vanished, leaving her with a very youthful and attractive feminine face.  Her makeup still seems a bit too heavy-handed, though.;
[status]               Caroline's face appears young and wrinkle-free, an interesting combination with her $BODY$.  Her makeup is still a bit off, too thick and unnatural.;

[tgShade]            face 33;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Some of the makeup on Caroline's face that was doing more of a disservice seems to wash itself away, leaving her face youthful and natural, her eyelashes long and lips plump and pink.  She truly looks like a supermodel again, at least in that aspect.  Her vanity knows few bounds as she takes a solid minute and a half to admire herself.;
[status]               Caroline has a youthful, attractive feminine face with just the right amount of makeup to enhance her natural beauty.  She looks as though she could easily be on the front page of Covergirl Magazine again.;

[tgShade]            face 50;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Caroline makes some weird, strained expressions, blinking and wincing in slightly jerky intervals.  She runs the fingers on her $HANDS$ along her cheeks with a confused expression.  Somehow her skin seems a little stiff and plastic-like, but it doesn't keep her from trying to speak in her $VOICE$..;
[status]               Caroline's attractive supermode-like face seems to change expressions in slightly twitchy movements as if it is taking a bit of extra effort to move.  Her skin looks a little waxy too.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Caroline rubs her face with her $HANDS$, breathing slightly heavily in her $VOICE$.  Her eye movements seem sluggish, her expression defaulting to a sort of bored look.  Her skin looks waxy, not flesh but a waxy plastic with the skin tones painted on.  She can still form different expressions, but she seems to be straining more and more to do so.;
[status]               Caroline's eye movements seem slow, her expression defaulting to a sort of bored look.  Her skin looks waxy, not flesh but a waxy plastic with the skin tones painted on.  She can still form different expressions, but she seems to be straining more and more to do so.;

[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Caroline's face loses the last humanlike qualities to it, her skin fully replaced by a flesh-toned plastic with makeup expertly painted on.  Her facial expression is frozen in a smug, slightly bored looking expression that seems to say 'you all bore me, but admire me all you want.'  Her eyes are a painted white, frozen staring straight ahead.  But despite this, you feel as though she is fully capable of observing what is going on around her.;
[status]               Caroline's face is fully plastic, frozen into  a smug, slightly bored looking expression that seems to say 'you all bore me, but I don't mind you admiring me.'

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Caroline is forty-five years old and five foot five.  She seems to move with a slightly tired step, having lived life fast and quickly without serious consideration of the consequences.;

[tf]               Caroline gasps, the eyes on her $FACE$ wide as she grows a couple inches taller to five foot seven.  She looks pleased with herself.;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Caroline gasps in her $VOICE$ as she grows another couple inches to five foot  nine.  Her $FACE$ beams with pride--you recall that some years ago some asshole critic had shamed her in the papers about her height.;
[status]               Caroline is forty-five years old and stands at five foot nine, four inches taller than when she walked into this gameshow.  ;

[tgShade]            body 40;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Caroline seems to glimmer for a few seconds.  She leans toward a mirror, running her $HANDS$ along her $FACE$ to discover that some of her wrinkles have retreated into her skin.  She now only looks to be about thirty-five, a good ten years younger.  She giggles in her $VOICE$ excitedly.;
[status]               Caroline looks younger than before, about thirty five years old and standing at five foot nine.;
[short]               thirt-five year old body at five feet nine inches tall;
[tgShade]            body 60;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Caroline squeals in excitement as her general form and posture become more youthful.  She now looks to be in her late twenties--perhaps slightly on the old side for the age-critical environment of a model, but certainly with a few years left of a career.  She giggles contently in her $VOICE$ and sometimes seems to forget that she is still playing a round in this gameshow.;
[status]               Caroline looks younger than before, about twenty eight years old and standing at five foot nine.;
[short]               twenty-eight year old body at five feet nine inches tall;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Caroline steadies herself as she magically grows another couple inches just shy of six feet tall.  Not only that, but even the slightest hints of aging--the most timid of wrinkles--vanish, leaving her looking at a youthful twenty-three years old at the absolute pinnacle of her youth and beauty.  At this age she could begin a modeling career all over again!;
[status]               Caroline looks younger than before, aged an ideal twenty three years old, prime age for another five years of a modeling career.   She stands just short of six feet tall, looking rather sexy in her $SHIRT$.;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Caroline has a slightly raspy voice from having smoked too many cigarettes in the past couple decades.  Her voice that could once melt hearts only succeeds in melting away crowds.;
[short]               raspy, cigarette-worn voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Caroline smiles and giggles, humming gleefully.  Her raspy voice sounds a bit smoother and clearer than before, less damaged by her smoking habit.;
[status]               Caroline speaks in an only slightly raspy voice, but it is a lot smoother and clearer (and sexier) than before.;
[short]               slighty raspy voice;
[tgShade]            voice 16;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Caroline practically breaks out into song as her voice loses its last hint of cigarette-induced raspiness, coming out strong and clear for the first time in many years.  Her voice is now clearly a sexy, pouty soprano that can stir hearts--not to mention groins.;
[status]               Caroline now speaks in a clear, sexy, pouty soprano voice that can melt hearts.;

[tf]               Caroline's pouty soprano voice sounds a bit fainter than before.  She has to try a bit harder to be heard, but otherwise little seems to have changed.;
[status]               Caroline has a sexy, pouty soprano voice, although she can't speak as loudly as before.;
[short]               slightly quiet, pouty soprano voice;
[tgShade]            voice 50;
[WaitFor]           body 5;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Caroline rubs her throat with her $HANDS$ as she tries to speak.  You can still hear her speak in her pouty soprano voice, but it seems oddly dampened.  She looks and sounds as if she were talking at the top of her voice, but only a normal conversation volume seems to emerge from her throat.;
[status]               Caroline has a sexy soprano voice, but she has to try quite hard to project the volume enough to be heard.;
[short]               quiet, pouty soprano voice;
[tgShade]            voice 66;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Caroline coughs, clearing her throat, but her voice comes out so faintly and indistinctly that she needs a special microphone to be heard.  More and more she has to rely on making gestures with her $HANDS$ in order to be understood.;
[status]               Caroline has an extremely faint soprano voice that requires a special microphone for anyone to hear.;
[short]               nearly silent soprano voice;
[tgShade]            voice 83;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Caroline gasps one last time before her voice fades away completely, leaving her absolutely mute.  She can still somewhat mouth words with her $FACE$, but the only way she can adequately communicate now is by submitting written responses from the touchscreen on her podium.;
[status]               Caroline's voice is completely inaudible, forcing her to rely on a system of gesturing with her $HANDS$ and writing her responses down to communicate.;

[WAIST];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               It is inevitable, but over the years Caroline has put on a bit of pudge around her stomach and waist over the years.  It's a bit more noticeable under her $SHIRT$ than she seems to notice--either that or she chooses to pretend not to.;
[short]               slightly pudgy stomach and waist ;
[tgShade]            waist 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Caroline clutches her stomach with her $HANDS$, her $FACE$ twisted into discomfort at first.  But when the pain seems to recede, she pats her midbody down, ten pounds slimmer.  She still has a little bit of excess padding there, but not much.;
[status]               Caroline has a tiny bit of fat around her stomach and waist underneath her $SHIRT$, but she appears at least ten pounds thinner than before. ;
[short]               minimally pudgy stomach and waist ;
[tgShade]            waist 25;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Rather than looking alarmed or scared, Caroline only grins as the fat around her waist vanishes completely, leaving her flat-bellied and smooth from her $BUTT$ to her $SHOULDERS$.  She runs her fingers along her new countours in admiration--she hasn't been this thin since the peak of her fame back in the nineties.;
[status]               Caroline has a thin and flat stomach, absolutely no excess fat around her stomach or waist underneath her $SHIRT$, back like she used to be in her prime in the nineties. ;
[short]               absolutely flat stomach and curvy waist ;
[tgShade]            waist 50;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Caroline seems to have a little more trouble moving her spine, finding it difficult to lean in any direction without losing her balance somewhat.  This causes her to move a little stiffly and jerkily, hanging onto the podium with her $ARMS$ a bit more to maintain balance.;
[status]               Caroline has a thin and flat stomach, absolutely no excess fat around her stomach or waist underneath her $SHIRT$, back like she used to be in her prime in the nineties.  She seems to have some difficulty rotating her waist or moving her spine.;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Caroline stiffens her $BODY$ up for a moment.  Very carefully she steadies herself and rubs her slim belly underneath her $SHIRT$.  Her skin doesn't seem to deform in the slightest, absolutely rigid.  She taps on it with the fingers on her $HANDS$ to reveal an empty sounding knock like the sound of hardened plastic.  No wonder she can't move her midsection--that part of her body has turned into plastic!  On the plus side, she'll never put on any pounds there.;
[status]               Caroline has a thin and flat stomach, absolutely no excess fat around her stomach or waist underneath her $SHIRT$, back like she used to be in her prime in the nineties.  It seems to be fully made out of plastic, leaving her unable to move her midbody.;

[SHOULDERS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               After years of being out in the sun in beach-setting photoshoots, Caroline's shoulders are speckled with sunspots and blemishes that makeup can only do so much to conceal.  There's also a little bit of padding around her upper $ARMS$ and neck, both a combination of age of a few extra pounds.;
[short]               sun-speckled, slightly sagging shoulders;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You hear a cracking sound and see Carolin wince.  The only result, however, if that her shoulders seem to stand a bit taller and shapelier, the skin exposed by her $SHIRT$ somewhat clearer of sunspots and blemishes.;
[status]               Caroline's shoulders are a bit curvier and shapelier, the skin exposed by her $SHIRT$ a bit clearer and softer.;
[short]               slightly blemished shoulders;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Caroline's shoulders crack and shift around once again, becoming smooth with a defined yet sleek collarbone and toned muscle.  The remaining blemishes and sunspots on her skin shown underneath her $SHIRT$  all vanish, leaving it crystal-clear and soft like a supermodel.  You can only imagine how many men would love to pull clothes up off of them.;
[status]               Caroline's shoulders underneath her $SHIRT$ are smooth and soft, the skin perfectly free of blemishes or sunspots without any need for makeup whatsoever.  You can only imagine how many men would love to pull clothes up off of them.;
[short]               soft, blemish-free curvaceous shoulders;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Some of the skin around Caroline's sexy shoulders begin to take on a slightly waxy glimmer to them.  She rubs at them with her $HANDS$, discovering that her skin has grown tough like plastic--not fully so, but enough that she has difficulty lifting or rotating her shoulders.  She doesn't try and fight the transformation, quickly adopting a static position that she can hold amazingly well.;
[status]               Caroline's shoulders underneath her $SHIRT$ are smooth and soft, the skin perfectly free of blemishes or sunspots without any need for makeup whatsoever.  They have a somewhat plastic look to them and she seem to have some difficulty moving them.;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Caroline stands still as the waxy look and material that has partially replaced the skin on her shoulders creeps around her neck and down to her $BREASTS$, leaving the entire region a skin-toned, immobile plastic.  Even though it means Caroline can barely move, she keeps a contented smile on her $FACE$.;
[status]               Caroline's shoulders underneath her $SHIRT$ are smooth and soft, the skin perfectly free of blemishes or sunspots without any need for makeup whatsoever.  They are fully made out of a skin-toned plastic that she is incapable of moving, though she doesn't even try, seemingly happy enough to have her form preserved so perfectly.;

[tf]               A small, silver necklace appears around Caroline's neck, the chain made of fine silver interlocking pieces that somehow seems to match the look of her $FACE$..  It looks as though it could easily cost a thousand dollars, the kind of jewelry a regular woman might only receive once in a decade, yet Caroline wears it casually.;

However, the dress is a couple decades old, and it hasn't stood the age of time all that well and is meant to fit a much younger and fitter woman that Caroline currently is.;

[tf]               Caroline's silver dress shrinks a bit, tightening around her $WAIST$ and $BUTT$ to show off her curves a little better.  Not only that, but the neckline lowers a little to show off a bit more of her $BREASTS$.  Caroline looks pleased and struts around her podium, swaying her hips in a manner that's meant to be seductive.;

[tf]               Caroline takes a few cautious breaths as her silver dress contracts again to better fit her $WAIST$, $BREASTS$, and $BUTT$.  It fits her figure perfectly now, perfectly tailored to every dimension of her body.  Not only that, but the shoulder straps shrink to two small spaghetti strands.;
[status]               Caroline is wearing is a silver dress that reaches down to her $SHOES$, the shoulder straps shrunk down to tiny spaghetti strands.  The dress hugs every inch of her contours tightly, showing off her assets amazingly well.;

[tf]               The hem of Caroline's form-fitting silver dress recedes from her $SHOES$ to her her ankles, showing off her $SHOES$ to sight a bit more clearly.  In addition, the spaghetti strap vanishes entirely,  becoming a strapless dress that exposes all of her  $SHOULDERS$.  Caroline only looks prouder and prouder to have her old dress being restored to an all new glory.;
[status]               The hem of Caroline's  form-fitting strapless silver dress has risen up to her ankles, showing off her $SHOES$.  Caroline looks honored to be wearing such an article of beauty.;

[tf]               The neckline of Caroline's silver strapless dress sinks even lower to only a few inches above her belly button, exposing a long stretch of skin from her $SHOULDERS$ and the central sides of her $BREASTS$.  If the dress weren't so tight she'd soon find herself having a "wardrobe malfunction."  Caroline giggles in her $VOICE$, seemingly both embarrassed and giddy at showing off so much skin, even more than she could get away with back in her youth.;
[status]               Caroline is wearing an ankle-length, form-fitting strapless silver dress that has a long strip reach down from her $SHOULDERS$ to just above her bellybutton, showing off significant portions of her $BREASTS$.;

[tf]               Caroline's dress shrinks again, the hem rising from her ankles to her knees, the gap around her legs rather small to force her to take small, dainty steps in her $SHOES$.  In addition, the dress takes on a silky shine and some artificial--or perhaps not--diamonds appear sewn  around the slit running up and down her $BREASTS$.  It looks immensely expensive and equally sexy, fitting for a supermodel like herself.;

A long vertical slit exposes portions of her $BREASTS$ with diamonds woven into the lacing.  It looks immensely expensive and equally sexy, fitting for a supermodel like herself.;

[Desc]               <blue>You are Slate Stintman, the man, the myth, the legend. Ok, maybe that's a bit too much, but it's not like anyone'd disagree. Your six foot body is covered with muscle, all glistening and earned. Anything to not look like those fatties down at the burger joint. You step up to the podium, making sure the cameras get your good sides, and sneer at your opponent. They don't even look like they lift.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>Finally. The game is over. You don't even care that you lost. Heck, at some points you were losing intentionally. At least the game's done, and you can go home, back to your apartment with your waterbed and your Shojo-ai and your webcam. You run off so quickly that you forget to even congratulate the winner.

 
Life quickly becomes routine again. You get a lot more traffic online now due to you being "that Transformania Time jock", though you don't know what they mean by 'jock'. Probably another mean joke about your physique. Nonetheless, your time is split between posing for your 'fans', binging CSGO (voice chat off, obviously!), and completing your Ecchi collection. It's a humble life, but a good one.</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You've got a confident voice that can make the ground rumble if you pitch it just right.;
[short]               low and powerful voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You call out to complain about that bull of a round, but the words don't come out right. They sound quieter and weaker.;
[status]               This stupid gameshow has taken the volume of your voice away from you.;
[short]               weaker voice;
[tgShade]            voice 20;
[WaitFor]           face 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Again you shout at the host for this stupid game, only for them to not even hear you. Although, once you hear your voice, you're glad they didn't. Alongside another decrease in volume, it's gotten, higher, like a whiny teen.;
[status]               Your voice is quiet and high, and nothing like the muscly jock you are. But maybe the whimpering twig you're becoming...;
[short]               higher, quieter voice;
[tgShade]            voice 40;
[WaitFor]           face 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You're about to pipe up at another loss, but stop yourself, instead quietly testing your voice out with a few random words. Just as you suspected, it has changed again, but you're still shocked at the result. It's now so high and so delicate that it could only belong to a woman, and you're so taken aback at this that you forget to question why the first word that popped in your head was "Latency"...;
[status]               Your voice is high and delicate, altogether feminine.;
[short]               girly voice;
[tgShade]            voice 60;
[WaitFor]           groin 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               The situation with your $GROIN$ takes your attention away from the lost round for a moment, but you HAVE to say something. You don't want to look like you've given up! You march over to the host, and... you can't get a word out. Maybe it's your nerves, maybe it's your arousal, maybe it's just the changes to your voice, but you can't say anything that isn't riddled with 'umms' and 'errs'. You give up, and slink over to your podium, looking for a corner that the cameras won't find you in.;
[status]               Your voice sounds high and flirty... when you can actually talk. Most of the time, you just stutter and stammer until the listener takes pity on you and walks away.;
[short]               stuttering voice;
[tgShade]            voice 80;
[WaitFor]           face 4;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Your arousal is too much, and you let out a loud and embarrassing moan, alongside some choice words. Coming to, you realise that you didn't stutter at all during that tirade! Your happiness is cut short by the realisation that you probably won't be touching yourself during job interviews or orders for pizza. ;
[status]               Mom always said you have a beautiful voice, so it's a shame you don't like to use it. Not only do you hate how it sounds, but you have a crippling stutter when talking to strangers. Not that anyone watching your livefeeds would know that, as you lose the stutter when in deep arousal, for some reason. ;
[short]               stuttering and slutty voice;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[WaitFor]           mind 8;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You are Slate Stintman, and you're feeling fine. You just got done your reps at the gym, so you're still feeling that good ol' runner's high. You actually came here on a dare from one of your mates, who told you you'd be in and out within the hour. Great, 'cuz this place reeks of geek.;
[short]               overconfident, jockish mind;
[tgShade]            mind 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You take stock of your situation as you lose another round (TOTALLY on purpose, by the way). So you've lost some body hair. Big whoop. You're sure it'll all grow back, even though it makes you look like some douchy swimmer. You still got this show in the palm of your hairless hand.;
[status]               You are Slate Stintman, and you're feeling pretty good. You've been through some changes but you're trying not to get down about them.;
[short]               shaken, but still confident mind;
[tgShade]            mind 12;
[WaitFor]           body 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Now you're starting to panic. Losing your body hair is one thing, but you weren't prepared for you to lose your muscles! You catch yourself pacing around your podium, caught up in your own thoughts, and the spiral of self-doubt becomes so steep that you almost wonder if they changed your mind, too. But no, they couldn't take that from you... right???;
[status]               You are Slate Stintman, and you're getting nervous. Your muscles are starting to disappear, and it's getting to your psyche.;
[short]               nervous mind;
[tgShade]            mind 25;
[WaitFor]           body 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               These changes are starting to add up, and you're feeling the pressure. Where once you stood a confident and brash man, now stands a worried and quivering baby, and you suspect that your bodily changes are only partly to blame. Aside from concern about your weakening body, the audience seems bigger, the cameras seem noisier, and the host seems more judging. You rub one shoe with the other's sole to distract yourself. ;
[status]               You are Slate Stintman, and you're a little fightened. Everything seems bigger and scarier, and you feel like running home and smothering yourself with blankets, cut off from the world. ;
[short]               nervous and fidgety mind;
[tgShade]            mind 37;
[WaitFor]           groin 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Your eyes reach the floor in embarrassment as you lose yet another round. Why did you even sign up for this stupid competition, again? As the rounds tick on, you can't remember why you'd have ever thought this game would be fun. The only thing pressing more on your mind than your continuous losses is your erection. How it aches in your $PANTS$. You can't remember the last time you were this horny, so could it be another change? ;
[status]               You are Slate Stintman, and you're terrified. Terrified and horny, for some weird reason. Even though your $GROIN$ is rock hard, you don't dare touch it, worried about the cameras.;
[short]               scared and aroused mind;
[tgShade]            mind 50;
[WaitFor]           body 4;
[WaitFor]           voice 2;
[WaitFor]           hair 2;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Are you even a man anymore? Your balls have both figuratively and literally been taken from you, and you look more and more feminine with every round. And this horniness... this can't be what all girls have to deal with, right? It isn't helping that you're catching yourself using more feminine mannerisms, either. At least your sexual orientation hasn't changed yet... which is sort of a plus.;
[status]               You are Slate Stintman, and you're slowly losing it. Not just with how many rounds you've lost, and not just with how timid you're becoming, but also how you're certain that you're getting girlier.;
[short]               slightly feminine mind;
[tgShade]            mind 62;
[WaitFor]           groin 4;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               It's come to the point where you aren't worried about losing your gender. Now you're worried about losing your identity. Already parts of your past are becoming murky, like your gym schedule and your condo, and whether you even have those two things. You're still thinking about girls, constantly, but even they have changed in your mind, now strong and butch women who'll take care of you. If there's a silver lining to all this, the rounds are getting easier, so maybe you're getting smarter, or at least better at games, which makes sense with all the LoL you play... Wait...;
[status]               You are Slate... Stintman, and you're fighting to remember who you are. You feel like some parts of your life have already left you, and this new person is clawing its way into your being.;
[short]               struggling and horny mind;
[tgShade]            mind 75;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               You meekly call for a bathroom break to... better acquaint yourself with you new equipment, but the host denies you. They probably know what's really going on. All the audience probably does. They know you're a dirty, fat slut who slums it online and can't even get a job without quoting a yuri. There's a lot of that thought that didn't really make sense, but your mind is putting the pieces together, while discarding the pieces of who you used to be. You're already unsure of your name now. ;
[status]               You are Slate Stintman. Or Alexandra McTwibb. Both of those names sound right, but the second one's starting to gain traction. ;
[short]               changing and nerdy mind;
[tgShade]            mind 87;
[WaitFor]           groin 5;
[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               No no no... you can feel it coming down below, if you cum you're certain you'll forget every- OHH!! You blurt out a lusty moan as you feel your juices soaking your $PANTS$. You can't even look the host in the eye as the cameras start flashing. Why do you squirt in the worst places, and can't jill yourself when you're actually getting paid to do it??? Over time, you regain what little composure you have left, and rejoin the game. If only this was a round of CSGO, then you'd mop the floor.;
[status]               You are Alexandra McTwibb, and you've had better days. Nerdy, shy, and with a terrible self-esteem, it takes a lot for you to get out of bed in the morning, so the fact that millions of people could be watching you perform on stage is nothing but terrifying. Not that it should be, you have no trouble 'performing' through a screen for anonymous strangers, as you've been a camgirl ever since you were kicked out of Mom's basement after you came out (and, well, those 5 gigs of hardcore on her computer...). More often, though, you use your computer for gaming, clocking in hundreds of hours on any number of MMOs and FPS's.;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You don't pay attention to your feet all that much, but you like how big they are.;
[short]               big feet;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               With what happened to your poor $LEGS$, you aren't surprised that you're feeling the same itch in your shoes, but it's still unsettling.;
[status]               Your feet, like your $LEGS$, are presumably hairless, but you haven't taken off your $SHOES$ to check.;
[short]               big hairless feet;
[tgShade]            feet 25;
[WaitFor]           legs 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               If it wasn't for your changed $LEGS$, you would've thought your changing feet were just cramps. As it stands, though, you're well aware that your feet have shrunk in size, even without taking off your $SHOES$.;
[status]               Your feet have probably halved in size, not that you can tell, what with your $SHOES$ still in the way.;
[short]               small feet;
[tgShade]            feet 50;
[WaitFor]           legs 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Just like your $HANDS$, your feet start cramping, and you're lucky enough to take off your $SHOES$ before they finish changing. You watch with all too much fear as they contract and reshape, turning into pretty, if stubby, feet. They almost look... feminine.;
[status]               Your feet are small and almost cute looking.;
[short]               dainty feet;
[tgShade]            feet 75;
[WaitFor]           hands 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Might as well do your toes, too. You sit down and take your $SHOES$ off, rubbing the polish brush on your toenails in a slightly neater way than your fingers, though that isn't saying much.;
[status]               Your feet are pretty ugly. Not that anyone's really seen your feet, much less commented on them, but you're sure that's what people would say about them. ;
[short]               little feet with polish;
[tgShade]            feet 100;
[WaitFor]           hands 4;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have big and burly hands with hair sprinkled on their backs.;
[short]               beefy hands;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               The hairs on the backs of your hands start to shed. Since you were expecting this to happen after your $ARMS$, you simply brush them off, irritated.;
[status]               Your hands don't have any hair on them, which doesn't look too conspicuous, but you're not a fan of the change.;
[short]               big and hairless hands;
[tgShade]            hands 25;
[WaitFor]           arms 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Irritated, you crack your knuckles to get rid of the strange cramps they've just acquired. While it does stop the pain, it also makes them smaller and spindlier.;
[status]               Your hands are nowhere near as big as they once were, but still at least carry that same strength.;
[short]               smaller hands;
[tgShade]            hands 50;
[WaitFor]           arms 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your hands cramp up again, and you hurriedly put them in your $PANTS$ so nobody can see them change. Eventually, you have to use them again for the next round, so you slowly pull out your new, weaker hands.;
[status]               Your hands have lost all of their considerable strength from the beginning.;
[short]               small and spindly hands;
[tgShade]            hands 75;
[WaitFor]           groin 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Oh no! You totally forgot to put nail polish on this morning! And after everyone's seen your stubby, ugly nails! You quickly take some polish from your pants pocket and sloppily scrub your nails before the cameras catch you.;
[status]               Your hands are your hands. Nothing too special about them. You do have strong fingers from all your DOTA play, and your nails are absolutely filthy, but other than that, nothing too remarkable.;
[short]               dainty hands with polish;
[tgShade]            hands 100;
[WaitFor]           mind 8;

[PANTS];

[status]               You are wearing some new jogging shorts that you got last week. ;
[short]               running shorts;
[tgShade]            pants 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your new jogging shorts stretch down to your ankles to become jogging pants. Besides them now covering up your $LEGS$, you don't mind.;
[status]               You have on a pair of stretchy black jogging pants. They look a bit too much like tights for your liking.;
[short]               jogging pants;
[tgShade]            pants 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your pants get baggier and baggier, generating more and more pockets and stains, until it's an ugly pair of cargo pants. Reaching into the pockets, you find glasses, some nail polish, and a USB stick. Confused, you try to forget about it for now.;
[status]               You are wearing a pair of cargo pants that scream "I only go outside for emergencies". You have a wide assortment of knickknacks in their pockets.;
[short]               baggy cargo pants;
[tgShade]            pants 66;
[WaitFor]           shirt 3;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Is something riding up your $BUTT$ again? You adjust your pants to find that your briefs have changed into a pair of cute panties that you can't help sneaking a peek at. If only the other changes could be so kind.;
[status]               Your no-nonsense cargo pants hide a frilly secret in the form of a pair of pink panties.;

[GROIN];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You've never been pleased with the size of your dick. It's no twig or anything, it's just not the monster that you know it should be. At least your balls are nice and hairy.;

[tgShade]            groin 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               The changes plaguing your $BODY$ almost makes you ignore a sudden erection tenting your $PANTS$.;
[status]               You have an uncomfortable erection, which isn't the end of the world, but it's a bit embarrassing what with thousands of people in the audience.;

[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               With all the scary changes to your $BODY$ and $MIND$, little Slate has been ignored, and this round he makes himself known. You almost reach under your $PANTS$ to grip your dick, but only stop when you see how smaller it's gotten. Wait... they're not going to turn you into a chick, too? This is all your mind needs to go into panic mode. ;
[status]               Your dick wasn't that massive before, and now looks to be only four inches, erect. This hasn't stopped it from making you uncomfortably horny.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               It's so hard not to touch your dick. It's there, just inside your $PANTS$, just above your $WAIST$, waiting... You shake your head to try to get rid of those thoughts, but they persist, as your dick shrinks even further. Seems like the more you think about sex, the smaller it gets. If that's the case, you're surprised you have a dick at all.;
[status]               Your dick's probably about two inches now, and your balls have shrunk with it. Your arousal, meanwhile, has grown to uncomfortable levels. It would be one thing if this happened at home, but there are so many people watching...;

[tgShade]            groin 50;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               A sucking sensation, almost like a blowjob but strangely below the dick, occurs in your crotch, and you do your best to not collapse and jerk off then and there. You do sneak a little peek in your $PANTS$, to find out that that sucking was your ballsack retreating into your body. What more, your dick lacks even a urethra, looking more and more like a woman's clit.;
[status]               You don't have a dick anymore. You can't call the stick of a bulge in your $PANTS$ a dick, and you've got no balls to speak of.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               A feeling of serenity take a hold of your $BODY$, before it plunges you into fire. You recognise it as arousal, but it's so much sharper, so much needier than before. With your $MIND$ being consumed by arousal, it glosses over the fact that you have a vagina in your $PANTS$ instead of a penis. Then again, you've been thinking of yourself as a girl for a while now... but no, you need to fight it...;
[status]               You are officially a girl. Outside, and nearly inside as well. You don't want to give your new vagina any attention because one, it will remind you that you're a girl, and two, you're horny as fuck. Oh, and the thousands of people watching, but you're well aware of them. How could you not?;

[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               A burst of flame fills your vagina again as it 'pretties up'. Any stray hairs are plucked, and your labia folds inwards a bit, while your clitorus bulges even more with blood and pleasure. It's taunting you, whispering "Touch me, Alex. Touch me!!"

Fat starts rushing in, thankfully hiding your bones, but its placed in a way that makes you look even girlier. As you're examining it, you catch yourself critisizing your own body. How your hips are too big, how your $BREASTS$ are too small...;

"The one plus about being so big", you mutter to yourself dryly, as you shift around your bra so as to not chafe your nipples. It soon starts to look like you're just playing with yourself, which may not be inaccurate, so you just deal with them for now.;
[status]               Men always say that they want big breasts on a woman, but assuredly not when the woman has fat on the rest of her. Even though you don't really care what men think of you in that way, you're constantly cursing your large breasts that just go to show how fat the rest of your $BODY$ is. You can't even wear a bra comfortably, as your big stupid nipples rub up on it. It's not usually a problem, though, as you just go braless at home, and sometimes can't even bother wear a shirt.;

It seems like minutes before you can finally see again, and looking in the mirror, your face has become unrecognizable. Your eyes, now a sparkling green, have enlarged and their lashes have nearly doubled, your lips are poutier and redder, and you have an unusual lack of an adam's apple bulge, even though your voice hasn't changed. With horror, you realise that you can't tell if you're a man or a woman.;

So why did you just instinctively go for them?;
[status]               The face that stares back at you in the mirror isn't the sexiest one in the world by a long shot. For one, big thick rimmed glasses hide most of it. For another, it still looks too manly to be on a woman, but far to feminine to be anything else.;

[status]               You have legs that mimic the fat on your $BUTT$, fat, sure, but still curvy in a weird way. Somebody once complimented the shape of your legs during a show, but they were probably being sarcastic. ;

[WAIST];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You haven't worked on your core as much as you probably should, but it's decent as is. Faint outline of a sixpack, with not a shred of fat in sight. Maybe you'll put in some crunches next time you head out.;
[short]               fit waist;
[tgShade]            waist 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You suck your breath in, cursing the last round, and notice that your stomach hasn't gone back to it's resting position, now just a little bit smaller. It's not that bad of a change, all things considered, except you're obviously not wild about the loss of muscle.;
[status]               You have a thin waist that might be a bit too thin, now that you study it.;

[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Without thinking, you sharply inhale again, and you can already feel your waist start to shrink. But this time, it comes with a wholly unwanted bonus, as your hips creak out and expand. Feeling them with your $HANDS$, you come to the conclusion that the bones themselves have been altered.;
[status]               You have a thin, smooth waist, and your hips are anything but masculine.;

[WaitFor]           groin 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               This time, you let out a loud exhale, partly due to the lost round, but moreso due to everyone staring at you. Doing so, your waist follows suit, growing out even as you try desperately to suck it back in. You've even gained more weight on your already too wide hips!;
[status]               Your stomach is starting to get fat, and your hips are still expanding.;

[WaitFor]           mind 5;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You won't breathe out. You know what's going to happen if you do, and you're fat enough already. But you can't stop it, the breath coming out as a large and humiliating burp. Just as you suspected, your tummy bulges out with fat, and your hips are not far behind. You grip the pudge of your belly with your $HANDS$. You look like a pig!!;
[status]               Your stomach feels like it's ballooned out like you're pregnant. Mom always said that you "weren't fat at all",bless her, but you know the stares. You see the models on billboards with their perfect waists. You're a cow, plain and simple. If only you didn't have the appetite of a cow, you might be able to shed the pounds.;

[ARMS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               While not in as excellent shape as your $LEGS$, your arms are nothing to sneeze at. You can curl 30 pounds with these babies.;
[short]               muscly arms;
[tgShade]            arms 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You feel your arms get colder, and wonder if the AC's been turned on, before realising that nothing else on your body's cold. Turns out that your arms have lost all their manly hair. You roll up your sleeves, not caring how silly your arms look now. If that's the way they want to play...;
[status]               Your arms look like they've been waxed of hair.;
[short]               muscly, hairless arms;
[tgShade]            arms 16;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You get an ache in your arms, not unlike that lactic acid thing your trainer once droned about. As you try to remember what she said (she had a big rack that was VERY distracting) your arms' muscles start decreasing, until it looks like you've never lifted a day in your life.;
[status]               You have two pitiful noodles of arms that are making you feel very inferior.;
[short]               smaller arms;

[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You grimace as that burn in your arms comes back, stripping even more muscle from them. Now you look like you couldn't lift up a pencil, much less a dumbbell!;
[status]               And you thought the last change to your arms was bad. Now they look absolutely skeletal, to the point that you can see the bones.;

[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               At first, you welcome the gains to your arms, rubbing your $HANDS$ like some sort of Bond villain. Once you see your arms proper, however, you notice how feminine their shape has gotten, and how there's still none of that rippling muscle that you had before.;
[status]               Your arms have gained back their mass, to an extent. They look more like a girl's arms than a muscular macho man's.;

[WaitFor]           groin 2;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               As your arms gain more weight, you try to distract yourself by thinking 'happy thoughts'. This was a bad idea. At first you strain to remember gym meets and gym babes, but it soon turns into LAN parties and Cheetos, with Zarya softly carrying you and firing a barrier in your... you snap out of your fantasies in shock, and are greeted with another shock in the form of your fattened arms.;
[status]               Your arms have a bit too much fat for your liking, but they're not hams or anything.;
[short]               slightly pudgy arms;

[WaitFor]           mind 5;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Schoolyard jeers of "Piggy, Piggy!" overcome your senses as more fat goes over your arms. You try to shake the voices out of your head, adjusting your glasses.;
[status]               Your arms look like turkey wings, and you don't care if people disagree. The only exercise they get is either a strenuous LoL sesh, or by jilling off. Over time, you're not sure what you prefer... (Okay, it's jilling off);

[BUTT];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your ass is a firm and muscly piece of meat. It's big without looking fat, and so strong that you could probably crush a beer can between your cheeks if you clenched. ;
[short]               muscly ass;
[tgShade]            butt 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There's an ache in your ass that you first attribute to a wedgie, but it's actually your butt shrinking. You try to see the positives in this. At least you won't look like a girl from behind... not that you looked like one before.;
[status]               Your butt has shrunk a little, and you assume its muscle is gone with it.;
[short]               smaller butt;

[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               A strange feeling occurs in your butt, a bubbling sensation, like the crackling of Rice Krispies mixed with the satisfaction of popped bubble wrap. It doesn't take away the fact that you're still changing, and you snap out of the pleasure to see a changed behind. It's gained back some of its mass, but placed it in such a way that it looks like it'd be on a girl.;
[status]               You have the butt of a very tiny girl, and you hope it doesn't get any bigger. Although, it did feel pretty good...;
[short]               small but girly butt;
[tgShade]            butt 40;
[WaitFor]           groin 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               That bubbling feeling in your butt comes over you again, turning into a warm massage. You can't help but close your eyes and even let out an involuntary moan as you wiggle your hips. Ahhh... That was what you needed to take your mind off the game. Of course, once you look down, your nerves come back tenfold. Your ass has doubled in size! It looks absolutely massive, a true bubble butt, and you can't keep your $MIND$ off of how it wiggles. ;
[status]               Your butt is really big. Maybe not big enough to be in a rap song or anything, but too big to ignore, and DEFINITELY too big for a guy. You're also not thrilled with how enjoyable its changes are...;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               If it wasn't for the fact that you're gaining weight, you'd really, really enjoy how your butt changes, with the fat bubbling up and leaving you weak in the knees. More fat pools across your butt cheeks, making them not only bigger, but also curvier, sinking them down in a heartshape visible even through your $PANTS$. You absentmindedly think about trying anal, but shoot that thought down in disgust. You're still a man inside, dammit! ...Also, you'd need to find a girl willing to do it, and that would mean going outside and meeting people, and...;
[status]               Your butt, while still pretty fat, is also pretty sexy. It has that heartshape that boys, and hopefully some girls, allegedly go crazy over. Your cheeks have become near erogenous zones, and you're too nervous to touch them, in case you go overboard.;

[WaitFor]           mind 7;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               In a shocking display of ignorance of the crowd watching you, you rub your ass, moaning as it bubbles up again. Your $GROIN$ starts to blush as you grope, rub, and smack your ass like you were performing a show back home. And soon enough, you get more ass to play with, as the cheeks become flabby and fatty, but still perky and round. After the host clears their throat, you snap out of your ass assault with a squeak, suddenly noticing all the audience... watching you... you nearly burst into tears.;
[status]               Your fat butt is your moneymaker, you guess. When people online aren't looking for fatties, they're looking for someone with a big, juicy butt, and if you weren't sooo chubby everywhere else, you'd almost be happy with it. It's the kind of butt you see in rap videos and magazine covers: plump and perky, with two round orbs that jiggle just the right amount when slapped. It doesn't hurt that your cheeks are really sensitive. In a humiliating display, you once orgasmed during a show just by smacking them. Another reason why you don't go out in public. Imagine if you came just from sitting down too quickly...;

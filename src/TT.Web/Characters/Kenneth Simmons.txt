[Desc]               <blue>A smokebomb, a flash of light-- and out comes Kenneth Simmons-sensei from the shadows. You're the fiercest shinobi in the land, or at least in your suburb. You don't need petty things like a girlfriend, or a job, or showers. You know that your anime expertise will prove to be enough. You almost feel sorry for the worthless opponent that gets in your way. They know not what they fight against. And if they end up a mewling mess on the floor, sliced into pieces with your dual katanas-- hey, it's nothing personal, kid.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>Finally! The game's over! Drinking sake all day has its perks, but you need to get your taint wet. The game's changed you into a hefty trickster spirit, a tanuki, even though the best you can do with magic could be outdone by a street performer. Still, you drink and you fuck, that's all you need. And though you've done a fair amount of drinking, you need to do some things not fit for primetime, so you disappear in a cloud of smoke... only to reappear three feet away. Tail literally between your legs, you stumble outside to your new life. 
Being a constantly horny tanuki has its perks. For one, no alcohol poisoning. If that were the case, your ancestors would be shit-faced. Hell, some of them are regardless. Another perk? A constant string of partners. You make a habit of fucking a different human every night, going so far to erase memories if necessary. Long-term relationships make your fur stand on end. Perhaps in a thousand years, you'll settle down and actually learn how to do some real magic, but for now, you're happy being a pudgy and lusty tanuki girl.</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You LOVE the sound of your voice. It's loud and commanding, no matter what others say. And you get to hear it a lot, every time someone questions the masterpiece that is Attack on Titan.;
[short]               nasally and annoying voice;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You scoff at the results of the game, only to let out a rather nasty voice crack. Embarrassing... but whatever that was, it made most of your nasality disappear. You like the change... but there must be a catch.;
[status]               It still feels weird to hear your own voice, as it has been stripped of its nasality.;
[short]               annoying voice;
[tgShade]            voice 33;
[WaitFor]           breasts 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Another voice crack is inflicted upon you, and you sigh, speaking into your hand to hear the damage. Sure enough, your voice has gotten higher, at the cost of its volume, which you find out when you speak a little too loudly, the host looking at you in confusion. Your $FACE$ goes red, and you let out a quiet apology.;
[status]               Your voice has gotten higher, sounding like a prepubescent boy, if the boy was constantly whispering. A part of you likes the change, but you realise that's the changes talking.;
[short]               higher voice;
[tgShade]            voice 66;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               For the third time, you race to the mirror, feeling a lump in your throat... but nothing seems to happen. Confused, you ask what's going on, and hear your voice crack. So it was your voice all along. You experiment with different words, noting how quiet your voice is now, but it takes around a dozen words for you to realise that half of them were in Japanese. Sure enough, it looks like you've gained a new language from the change.;
[status]               You quite like your voice, as it is high without being grating, and quiet without being inaudible. You can speak both Japanese and English, though you prefer Japanese, if only to stay close to your roots.;
[short]               high and quiet voice;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[WaitFor]           face 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               As soon as you lose your latest round, your throat feels itchy. Coughing, you ask the host for a drink, only for it to come out in a singsongy, almost teasing fashion. Though you're shocked with the change, the host doesn't seem to hear you, so you ask again, this time unintentionally putting more emphasis into your words, making them seem more... private. Sure enough, this gets their attention, and they give you a drink on the spot. Hmm...;
[status]               Your voice has gained an interesting lilt that makes it sound like you're constantly flirting. It seems to get men's attention, though.;
[short]               flirty voice;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[WaitFor]           hair 4;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You snicker, noticing your changes before it is apparent to the audience, and you whisper into your hand, before pointing to a man in the audience. He wordlessly stands up and leaves. The host looks at you questioningly, and security glances your way, but before anything comes out of it, the man returns with a bottle of absinthe, laying it in your open $HANDS$. "Itadakumasu~", you trill, before chugging the bottle. You're kinda surprised that worked!;
[status]               As a tanuki, illusory magic is your thing, and thus your voice is paramount in bossing around the humans. You don't abuse your power... much... on weekdays... but when you do, it's rarely anything that can't be fixed immediately. For one, you're too weak to cast anything too powerful, and for another, you couldn't be assed.;

[WaitFor]           face 6;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You're pretty sure you're half-Japanese, at least. You've got two katanas on your wall, you know all the hiragana, and you've watched every episode of Naruto. You're thinking about moving to Japan soon, since nobody here understands your Eastern ways.;
[short]               arrogant weeaboo mind;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Well, that wasn't so bad! They pretty much just did a spa treatment on you, but way cooler. Why don't people go on here more often? As you're strutting off the stage, the host stops you, informing you there's more to the game. Oh... well, how were you supposed to know?!;
[status]               Apparently the game isn't over, despite you being already perfect. Perhaps they'll turn you into a powerful kitsune?;
[short]               arrogant weeaboo mind;

[WaitFor]           shirt 1;
[WaitFor]           body 1;
[WaitFor]           hair 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Well... this has been unexpected. You've got a pretty boy face and a pair of tits, and your only solace is your big dick, something that could very well be just an erection. But you couldn't be getting hard from this... could you? No, you decide. It isn't proper. That word puts you at a pause. Since when did you worry about being proper? Then it hits you. The game's already changed your body, how hard would it really be for it to change your mind as well? Panicked, you rally off your personal information, and while it's a bit blurry, you can make it all out... for now.;
[status]               The game's turning you into a girl... both inside and out. You catch yourself caring way too much about how you look, sometimes brushing aside your $HAIR$, sometimes adjusting your $SHIRT$. Even your anime tastes have changed. You're pretty sure you weren't into Ao Haru Ride before...;
[short]               mellower mind;

[WaitFor]           face 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Another round lost, and a blush encompasses your $FACE$. You'd probably do better at this if there wasn't so many people gawking at you, especially that baka in the front row. Not that he isn't cute, but his eyes are incredibly pushy... you slap a hand to your mouth, as if you'd said that out loud. The changes! You frantically rail off your personal information in your head to find... nothing. You can't remember where you're from. You can't remember your name. You can't even remember your sex!;
[status]               Your mind is pretty close to a blank slate right now. You don't know if you're a man or a woman, American or Japanese, straight or into girls. None of the answers are clear to you, and it gives you a headache just thinking about them. Maybe if you win enough rounds, they'll fill you in?;
[short]               addled and confused mind;

[WaitFor]           hair 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               All of it is starting to come together. Your $GROIN$, your $WAIST$, your $VOICE$... you're a girl, surely. That makes the most sense. You can't help but crack a smile, that part of your psyche answered. Now you need to remember your name (no, not THAT Your Name. You've cried too many times to forget that...), and your nationality. You want to say Japanese, but there are some Western thoughts sticking to your mind... perhaps Asian-American?;
[status]               A lot of things about your life are still a mystery, but you've at least cracked the code about your gender, and therefore sex. And not that gender is forever linked to sex-- you've seen Utena, too-- but being a woman feels... righter, than being a man.;

[WaitFor]           voice 3;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You brush off your $PANTS$, cursing yourself for not wearing something more formal, what with all these cameras chasing you... Byouso, Mujima-sama, you mutter to yourself dryly. If you couldn't handle the pressure, you wouldn't have signed up for such a silly show. ...Why DID you sign up for this, again?;
[status]               You are Kurimi Mujima, though you begrudgingly let your American friends call you 'Kuri'. They mean well, after all. You're not sure how you got on this tacky gameshow, but then again, you've been forgetting a lot of things today. You might not be strong, or brave, or... really anything. But you have a good heart and a strong moral compass, and you feel that's quite enough to get by.;
[short]               demure foreign mind;

[WaitFor]           legs 2;
[WaitFor]           feet 2;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Just as you were thinking about your improper assets, a burst of energy literally sweeps you off your $FEET$, slamming you to the ground. You shakily get up, cursing your low alcohol tolerance, and even though you're pretty sure you didn't hit your head, things feel... different. You have knowledge of thousands of years of ancient Japanese history located in your mind, and it's hard to keep your head straight with all this information. So you focus on more important things... like how that dude in the yellow shirt's clearly checking you out. Gawk all you want, Mister...;
[status]               Your brain is so full of knowledge about trivial things that it's hard to keep track of the things you know are important. You've also gained a flirtatious edge, winking at members of the audience. Even so, you feel like all the information about ancient rituals and practices are important, somehow...;
[short]               intelligent and flirty mind;
[tgShade]            mind 100;

[WaitFor]           voice 4;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               It's pretty clear by now that the alcohol's hitting you hard. Not in the sense that you feel particularly drunk, but your mind is going down weird paths. All of the history that's been crammed into your mind from the previous changes is hurting your head, so you push some of it out. There's just one problem: you're too drunk to get a proper grasp on your memories, so those thoughts of boozing, fucking, and your cousin that turned himself into a bottle stay in, whereas your name, your family, and your morals come guzzling out like cheap sake. Speaking of which... you down another bottle, this time drinking it in a single gulp. Kanpai, indeed...;
[status]               Your mind is a mishmash of human and inhuman, so much so that it's a miracle that you're so drunk, or else the swirling of man and beast would have driven you eternally mad. Luckily, you're too drunk to care, gulping down sake and singing horribly filthy songs while the Kurimi you once knew fades.;

[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               "Kanpai~!!" You yell out, opening your umpteenth bottle of sake with your cleavage, chugging it down before throwing it at the host. It misses wildly, but who cares?! You're having way too much fun to talk about 'honour' and 'respect' and 'getting security'. In fact... you snicker, locking eyes with the score board, and whisper a few words with all your might... only to hear an angry cleared throat. Gasping for breath, you see a cross host with two even crosser security, no changes to the scoreboard, and another trick thwarted due to your miserable magic acuity. You drown your sorrows in another nihonshu, and the memory's forgotten.;
[status]               You are Kasumi Seiyoku-danuki, but humans can call you Kasumi. Better yet, they can call you their superior. A trickster tanuki with more libido than talent, you've ran away from a boring ol' shrine in Hokkaido to frolic with the real party animals: humans. Though you've got the magical skill of a Karakasa, your appetite for both sex and sake make you a force to be reckoned with-- though one might get the upper hand come the morning after.;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You've got a massive pair of feet. And the ladies all know what that means...;
[short]               big feet;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You adjust your stance, scratching the back of your ankle with your other foot. Something is going on down there, but you don't wanna take off your $SHOES$ and see nail polish or something.;
[status]               Your feet are itching in your $SHOES$, but you don't dare take a peek. You don't want more reminders of what's happening to you.;
[short]               uncomfortably itchy feet;
[tgShade]            feet 50;
[WaitFor]           hands 2;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Due to your new $SHOES$, you can now see the changes that inflict your feet, shrinking down to a size that would be small even for a girl. Thankfully, your $SHOES$ have shrunk alongside them, so they're not too loose.;
[status]               You have very tiny feet, which makes shopping for shoes a bit of a hassle.;
[short]               tiny feet;
[tgShade]            feet 100;
[WaitFor]           shoes 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Much like your hands, your feet gain black nails that you brush off as polish when asked about it by humans. But feet are boring, so you forget about them, going back to contemplating how to get that girl in the front row to take off her panties...;
[status]               Your feet are tiny and cute, probably the only cute thing on you. Aside from sporting heels, you don't really put them to use that often. You have black nails on them, just like your $HANDS$.;

[WaitFor]           hands 4;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your hands are smaller than you'd like them to be, and it always hurts when you shake someone's hand (not that you remember the last time you did that). You have a bad habit of biting your nails.;
[short]               small hands with bitten nails;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Feeling nervous, you put your fingers to your mouth, only for your nails to poke your lips. The game must have grew out your fingernails when you weren't looking, but it doesn't stop you from biting them again. Though unbeknownt to you, they're healed once more the moment you put your hands down.;
[status]               Not only are your fingernails longer and unbitten, but the dirt underneath them has vanished.;
[short]               small hands with clean nails;
[tgShade]            hands 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You crack your knuckles, and the pop comes out louder than usual, almost like you've crushed your hands. That's not far from the truth, as you look at your now small hands, smooth and thin. Just like a girl's... you shudder.;
[status]               Your hands are pretty tiny now, and you're constantly reminded of their size any time you make a fist, which you keep doing like a reflex. It occurs to you that you've stopped biting your nails.;
[short]               slimmer hands;
[tgShade]            hands 66;
[WaitFor]           breasts 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your hands twitch, something you chalk up to nervousness at first, but on a second glance, you see that your nails have gained a clear shine to them. Right, you did put some polish on them for the occasion this morning, didn't you?;
[status]               Your hands are pretty average, though you have been the subject to a rather crass flirt about them... and so he got to know one of them better as it slapped his face. To you, however, they look ordinary. You take care of them, but you don't even wear any garish polish, instead opting for a more protective clear sheen.;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               With a sound not unlike the snapping of fingers, your fingernails are coloured black. It looks like polish, but a closer look would show that it's their natural colour.;
[status]               Your hands look pretty ordinary, and even your black nails look like polish. Oh, but if only one knew of the things your hands have done...;

[status]               You're wearing your lucky pants (and your lucky briefs), and even though they're stained with ketchup and... whatever that green stain is, they lose their power when washed.;
[short]               dirty jeans;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your pants shudder, then strip themselves of their stains and wrinkles, the mess literally peeling off of them and disappearing with a spark. Not only was it a sight to behold, but your pants are clean now! You should totally go here to get your clothes cleaned instead of having to wait on your 20 year old washing machine!;
[status]               Your lucky pants are now completely clean, bereft of stains and wrinkles. Though you miss that warm feeling they get when they're fresh out of the dryer... not that you put them in there that often.;

[tgShade]            pants 50;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Is your $BUTT$ growing again? You sigh, looking behind you to see the damage, only to find that the culprit was your new pair of jeans that hug your ass and $WAIST$ far too much for your liking.;
[status]               You are wearing a pair of super tight jeans that might be okay wearing around the house, but with an audience of thousands, shows a bit too much of your $BUTT$.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You shut your eyes, expecting the worst, when you feel a breeze on your $LEGS$. They probably put you in a thong! When you finally open your eyes to look at the damage, you find that the game only put you in a pair of capris. Oh... that's not so bad.;
[status]               You're now wearing a pair of capris, and while they're a bit too breezy, it's not the worst thing you could be wearing.;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               The capris you've been wearing spin around on your $LEGS$, shifting into a navy pencil skirt that's a tiny bit too high for formal wear. You reason with yourself that that was all you, and you really CAN dress yourself with magic without taking a twelve hour nap afterwards.;
[status]               You are wearing a pencil skirt that could confuse someone as being overly formal, until they notice how much of your $LEGS$ are showing. You don't wear panties, obviously. Only a prude would wear such a thing. No, you're ready for fucking whenever the mood strikes you... which is pretty much all the time.;

[status]               Your $PANTS$ hide a monster that strains them wide and makes the ladies cry out in pleasure. Okay, so it's only four inches erect, but it's not the size of the oar.;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There! See?! You've just gained a few inches on your dick! It can't be an erection, cuz there's no hotties here, so that's all it could be. The changes are finally receding... right??;
[status]               You have a bigger dick, surely. Which obviously means you're not turning into a chick anymore. Phew. ;

You should be angry, or even horrified, but all you can do is hope that the cameras don't take this as an opportunity to swarm over your junk.;
[status]               Your dick is now half the size it used to be, and that means it's pretty darn small.;

[tf]               You roll your eyes as your penis shrinks again, now more of a nub than anything else. Granted, you're glad that you have more room in your $PANTS$ now, but it begs the question, does this mean you're female? It certainly seems to be going that way.;
[status]               Not that you've been checking, but your penis is about the size of an penis' head, and your balls have receded into your abdomen, perhaps to prepare for what's to come?;

[tf]               It's happening. Your groin is changing. Muttering something about a bathroom break, you hurry to the washroom and pull down your $PANTS$, watching in awe as the already minuscule head of your formal penis retracts into a clit, while above it, a pit grows that makes your abdomen gurgle, organs shifting and growing to form a virgin vagina. At a loss for words, but feeling somehow complete, you stumble out of the washroom with a horrible thought: they wouldn't put cameras in the bathrooms... right?? ;
[status]               You sigh to yourself, forcing yourself to think about what's between your legs. You're no prude, despite what your friends say, but you'd prefer not to do anything rash until you meet the right guy. There's no rush. Other than that, the most you ever think about your vagina is when you shave your pubic hair. You haven't even played with yourself since you were 16.;

[status]               You're aroused. You don't know why, and you don't know how, but the heat between your $LEGS$ points to that and that alone. It's obviously not your surroundings, so it means the gameshow isn't just making you look like a slut-- it wants you to feel like one, too.;

You have friends with healthy sex lives, and you don't judge them for it. Except this isn't healthy. You know it isn't. Nearly creaming your pants at the sight of a hunk in the third row isn't healthy. Well... he is a stud... again, maybe you can live with this libido. Though you certainly can't live with this ache in your loins. You'll need to fix that right away.;
[status]               Where before you'd chastise yourself for looking at a man's biceps, now you can't keep your mind off of sex. Dirty, loud sex. The messier, the better. You want your cunt speared by a man in a traditional kimono while you eat out a geisha with fox ears... ugh. Maybe another drink will get your mind out of the gutter.;

Perhaps then he'll be able to match your lovemaking... nah, not a chance.;

Your cunt is always ready for a good fucking, and you are always happy to assist.;

[tf]               Aw, your favourite shirt changed when you weren't looking! Then again, you kinda like the change. The seams have been fixed, the colour's brighter, and it even has a cool Japanese phrase on it! At least, you assume it's cool. You can't really read it... at this angle, at least.;
[status]               Your favourite shirt has been replaced by a shirt that doesn't look too bad, either. It's cleaner and brighter than your old one, and it has a super deep Japanese phrase on it... whatever it is.;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Idly taking a glance at your chest to see if your $BREASTS$ have grown again, you take the time to read that phrase on your shirt. It's a bit hard to read, what with it being upside-down, but you think it says 'damu gaijin'... wait, damu gaijin?! It's calling you a stupid foreigner! How could you be a dumb foreigner when even YOU don't know where you're from!? But before you voice your complaints, the top changes into a more tasteful polo. Much better... even if it came with a snug bra.;
[status]               You're wearing a snug, but concealing polo shirt, complete with bra, of course. You might be able to go without one, but you don't want your nipples poking out of your shirt like some gyaru.;

[tf]               Your polo shirt vibrates on your chest, and gains a pleated style that looks like something you'd wear to a semi-formal restaurant. Finally, a change that you like!;
[status]               You are wearing a spiffy shirt that properly covers you up. With the other changes inflicted upon you, it almost seems too good to be true...;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Your $BREASTS$ are obviously way too important to be confined by a bra, so you tear it off, effortlessly undoing the straps before tossing it to the audience. While you were doing that, your shirt has morphed into a woman's business suit, though your nipples are tenting the undershirt. Like they should be.;
[status]               You are wearing some officewear that you saw some boss lady on TV wear once, and it really helps to trick humans into doing what you ask of them. It's comical how they'll will trust anyone in a tidy outfit. No bra, though: you're not THAT keen on pleasing humans!;

[status]               Your legs aren't that special. They're not very muscular, and you haven't got any hair on them yet, but what woman's gonna be enthralled by a man's legs?;
[short]               weak legs;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Though you don't have any hair on your legs to shed, you know that they are changing, rolling up your pantlegs to see their flesh twist and readjust, giving you a much-unwanted set of curves down there...;
[status]               Your legs don't look completely feminine, per se... but it's clear that they aren't a man's pair, either. They're far too curvy and smooth for that.;

[tf]               You feel your $PANTS$ bunch up around your legs, and you know that they're changing once again, filling out and giving you an even more curvy look. You roll your eyes.;
[status]               Your legs are a typical pair of woman's legs, or at least that's what you tell yourself. Your friends say you're lucky to have them, but for you it means more leers.;

[tf]               You wobble a bit. Surely the sake hasn't hit you already? As it turns out, the answer is far more insidious, as your legs have swelled out to clearly show how curvy you've become. Groaning, you down another cup.;
[status]               Your legs are big enough that they emphasise your $BUTT$ and $WAIST$, drawing too much attention to your curves.;

[tf]               Caught in another fantasy of a fourway, not to mention completely hammered from drink, you end up toppling to the ground. Embarrassing...though from this angle, you can see your new, plumper legs. They match your gravid hips, and you can't help but run a finger up one, getting closer to-- you pause, standing up. No, a tanuki doesn't play with herself in public. She gets others to do that for her.;
[status]               Much like the rest of your $BODY$, your legs are thick and plump, your thighs nearly touching even with the size of your hips. Nothing sags, however. It looks like this is just your body shape, and being a tanuki, it is.;

[tf]               That same burst of energy smacks your $BUTT$, but you're prepared for it now, standing your ground as the magic flows into you. Unfortunately, it's more of those boring rituals and celebrations threatening to overflow your mind. How dumb. You roll your eyes, scratching an itch above your ass.;
[status]               Something's happening to you, and it's not the changes. You feel almost... enlightened, somehow, but it's incomplete. Like trying to put a cork on a firework. And like a firework, you're certain that what's inside you will soon explode.;

[tf]               Wait... where the fuck's your tail?! You didn't leave it at the club again, did you? As soon as you ponder this, you hear a bell jingle, and your tail appears. Like all tanuki, it's brown with tan stripes, matching your ears. You catch your tail trying to sneak its way under your $PANTS$, and make a show of spanking yourself for your 'misbehaviour'.;
[status]               You're a tanuki, so you obviously have a tail. Duh. Alas, you can't fly with it like that game everyone was talking about a couple decades ago, and hell, you can barely turn into a statue. But who cares about that? Statues may be rock hard, but they don't get laid. In any case, your tail is more useful as a pillow than for any cool party tricks. Though it does keep you warm in the winter with how fluffy it is.;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your arms twitch and fill out, and at first you're happy with the change, since it at least gave you some much-needed muscle. Unfortunately, it's fat, not muscle, that coats your arms, though they still look fine. You could even go so far to say they look healthier this way.;
[status]               Your arms look pretty normal, even if you're waiting for them to turn girly and weak. It's only a matter of time.;

[tf]               You shiver, rubbing your arms to keep warm, only to feel what little hair you have on them slough off in your $HANDS$. Looking at your arms, they now look smooth and supple, almost like, well... a girl's.;
[status]               Your arms almost look like they came out of a spa, what with their hairless and shiny complexion.;

[tf]               You gulp as you watch your arms tan, gaining a golden hue. But the colour isn't the thing that scares you. No, what concerns you is the extra weight they've put on...;
[status]               Your arms have a pleasant tan, but all you can think of is their added weight. What is exactly in store for you??;

[tf]               Have your arms gotten bigger? You're too drunk to tell. Whatever. They're not fat or anything, and they're still smooth and tan, so who the hell cares? You chug another bottle.;
[status]               Your arms wouldn't really be called fat, but they certainly have some weight on them. Even so, they're beautifully tanned and intoxicatingly smooth, and compared to your $LEGS$, they'd be considered trim.;

[tf]               You grunt, actually hearing your hips grind as they widen. It's quite the unnerving sound even if it didn't come with wider hips.;
[status]               Your hips are wider than before, but they're not particularly feminine. At least... not yet.;

[tf]               You hear that tell-tale grinding, and you sigh, looking down at your hips. As you expected, you now sport hips that better suit your new $BUTT$. At least they're not extreme or anything...;
[status]               You tolerate your hips. While definitely not mannish, they aren't wide enough to draw any ugly stares.;

[tf]               As your hips flare out for the third time this match, you realise you need a drink. When asking for water, however, your throat clams up, and it comes out as 'sake'. Sake?! You can't be drinking sake on a gameshow! It'd be so uncouth! Still, the host offers a tray with a tiny sakazuki of sake, along with the bottle, putting it on a table you swear wasn't there before. Well, you HAVE to drink it now... Trying to act proper, you accidentally down it in a single gulp. Ugh... this is the worst day of your life... you pour up another drink. If you're gonna survive this, you might have to drink your way out. Kanpai!;
[status]               Your hips are much wider than you'd like, and so you're drinking to forget. Sure, you're drinking nihonshu on daytime television, but you deserve a buzz after what you've been through.;

[tf]               How many drinks have you had? Over a dozen, surely. But whenever you finish a bottle, you belly complains, so you grab another one. Not that the constant drinking hasn't had an effect on it. It sloshes with sake, round and plump, yet doesn't sag over your $GROIN$. And even now, it complains for more alcohol. Who are you to deny such a sexy stomach?;
[status]               Much like the figures of tanuki back home, you have quite the belly on you. The difference between you and the statues is that you can pull it off. And sure, maybe you're a bit overweight even for a tanuki. But at least you know how to have fun.;

[status]               Your butt is no longer misshapen, which is something you'd be happy about if it didn't signify... other changes...;

[tf]               You clutch your ass, only to take your hands off of it in abject embarrassment. It's not your fault! It was just growing again, now looking unmistakeably womanly. You hope that it doesn't grow again, albeit for completely different reasons than before...;
[status]               You make an effort to keep your butt nice and tight, even though you've been putting off a gym for months. Still, you make an effort to eat right, and it shows, your ass pert and fit.;

[tf]               While sitting down lamenting your fate, you wonder if someone put an extra pillow on your seat. But once you realise what actually happened, you're too ashamed to stand back up. It takes a stern talking to from the host to finally make you rise, cringing as the cameras flash at your new, larger butt.;
[status]               You have a butt that, to be fair, isn't TOO big, but you like it how it was before, all perky and tight and unnoticeable. With a butt like this, people will mistake you for some tramp!;

[tf]               Your drinking is interrupted by the seat of your $PANTS$ straining, and you shake your head, knowing exactly what is happening. As you look in the mirror, you notice immediately how large your ass has gotten. It looks like a stripper's butt, not a civilized lady like yourself! And yet... it looks pretty good on you. Throwing caution to the wind, you give it a smack, marvelling at its swivel.;
[status]               Your ass is pretty neat. It's taken some time to get used to it, but now you know why other guys like to see them. Not that you're attracted to your own ass, but the way it wiggles when you swing your hips definitely stirs something primal in you.;

[tf]               You giggle to yourself, spilling sake on the podium. At least you're getting a decent drink out of this! Still, you've had your treat. Now for a trick... You stumble off the podium, locking eyes with a dude in a tanktop and handing him a bottle. "Chugging contest, gaijin. First one to stop loses." Putting a bottle in his hand, he shrugs, taking a sip... before performing a spit-take as you moon him, still drinking your fill. Just as planned, the game takes this time to expand your ass, swelling it to two perfect near spherical cheeks that have clearly cast a spell on the man before you laid a finger on him. Snickering, you stick a finger in your $GROIN$, and mark the character "Butt" on his forehead, pushing him back into his chair. Strutting back with a swivel to your hips, you decide to pay the man a visit in a few days when he'll only be able to cum from a pegging...;
[status]               Your ass might be the best thing about you. It's definitely the thing everyone notices first. Your cheeks are thick and juicy, but you have enough strength in your cheeks to be able to move them one at a time, almost beckoning your next fuck over...;

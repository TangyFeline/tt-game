[Desc]               <blue>A small man (at 4'0"), the most remarkable thing about David Draco was a half heard mumble about being tired about having to store books in his living room.          

Plain brown hair topping a plain head of an average caucasian, David's thin body seems to be just a size too small for his brown tweed coat and faded green shirt, brown pants(ha), and brown worn loafers , he isn't swimming in them, but just barely, overall giving the appearance of a tired old librarian.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>You watch as the ruby red Belinda stretches while giving you and the audience a full view of her naked draconic beauty, and predatory stare, "Congratulations, seems we've both won, from a certain point of view." Confidently, she struts over to your side of the stage, smiling as her full head of height over you becomes even more readily apparent, "Perhaps, you'd be interested in 'winning' further? A hoard of knowledge is all well and good, but together we could gather something of more, substance?"

The increasingly large number of teeth in her smile makes it very obvious that it is probably a proposition you shouldn't refuse.</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Unlike everything else about him, there's one difference between David's voice in from the plain or average, it's the fact he's quiet and mumbles. "Stupid cutback, rather go bath in a ditch.";
[short]               quiet and average;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               "Urgh, my throa.." You watch as David starts to cough, interrupting his complaint.

After the fit finishes, he stops, clears his through, and in a different voice, a different timbre apologizes, while not really higher, you can't help think it more, feminine, then before.;
[status]               While more androgynous, David's voice isn't really any higher in pitch.;
[short]               androgynous voice;
[tgShade]            voice 34;
[WaitFor]           face 3;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Belinda coughs again, having not done so for a while, and again the timbre of her voice changes, becoming more feminine, and surprisingly deeper. 

This time however, instead of grumbling, she smiles.;
[status]               You listen as Belinda asks for some water, it's surprisingly feminine for how deep it is.;
[short]               deep feminine voice;
[tgPoint]            voice;
[WaitFor]           face 6;
[WaitFor]           mind 6;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               This time it's not a cough that comes out of Belinda's throat, but a gout of smoke, "Oh, excuse me." Apologising with a giggle.

Your fairly certain this isn't a good development for you.;
[status]               Belinda's voice has started taking on a sultry tone, surprisingly this isn't detracted by the fact that she's probably going to be able to breath fire soon.;
[short]               deep sultry voice;
[tgShade]            voice 70;
[WaitFor]           face 8;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You feel somewhat sorry for the heckler in the front row, Belinda's roar of, "That's ENOUGH!", followed by a blast of fire has certainly seared off most of his hair, you think he had a beard as well.

Finishing the water she had brought earlier, she gives you another smile.

You don't think the game you are playing is the one she's playing now.;
[status]               Belinda's voice has settled into a deep, warm, and sultry thing that worms into your head.

The fact that it can quickly be followed by fire keeps you from being too enamored.;
[short]               deep, warm, and sultry voice;

[SHOULDERS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               David's shoulder barely support his $SHIRT$;
[short]               thin shoulders;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Under Belinda's $SHIRT$, you think you see her shoulders actually broaden a bit, filling out.
It seems to be more to keep her proportions then anything else.;
[status]               Belinda's shoulders remain thin, at least in comparison to her $BODY$.;
[short]               thin shoulders;

[WaitFor]           mind 6;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               With the strain on her $SHIRT$ from her $CUSTOM2$ gone, it looks like her shoulders have made it their mission to take up the slack, and a bit more.;
[status]               With Belinda's growth, it can't be said that her shoulders aren't out of proportion, but you wouldn't call them thin any more.;
[short]               proportional shoulders;
[WaitFor]           shirt 4;
[WaitFor]           custom2 3;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Belinda's shoulders seem intent to keep up with the rest of her body.;
[status]               All you can think of Belinda's shoulders is that they are proportional to her body.;
[short]               proportional shoulders;
[WaitFor]           shirt 5;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               David's feet are in his $SHOES$;
[short]               average feet;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               It's when you first hear Belinda complain about her feet, you realize that nothing has happened to them till now.;
[status]               While hidden by her $SHOES$, you're sure that Belinda's feet have finally started changing.;
[short]               hidden feet;

[WaitFor]           legs 5;

[WaitFor]           mind 6;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               "Oh, oh urgg, damnit, damn Loafers."Belinda's feet are stretching her loafers in odd ways as they change further, unfortunately for her the changes involved have made it impossible for her to remove them at this time.;
[status]               Belinda's feet are trapped in her loafers, their increases in size effectively locking them in place.;
[short]               larger hidden and pained feet;
[tgShade]            feet 55;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You hear Belinda's $SHOES$ groan, along with her, as her feet grow again, the bulges are all the wrong shapes for them to just be too big however.;
[status]               You wonder if being trapped in too small footwear is doing damage to Belinda's feet.;
[short]               deformed feet;
[tgShade]            feet 60;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Freed from the $SHOES$ of her loafers the changes to Belinda's feet are all the more apparent, and they are changing further, with what was once her big toe sitting comfortably perpendicular to her feet. Her other toes at first seem more splayed, till you realize that they are longer, and her heel no longer sits comfortably on the floor, if the way it rises occasionally is any indication.;
[status]               It's when you look down at your own hands that the new form of Belinda's feet make some more sense, they're becoming more like hands. Really thick hands, but the 'fingers' are too long for something like a Gorilla's.;
[short]               handish, deformed feet;
[tgShade]            feet 67;
[WaitFor]           shoes 2;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You're amazed as you watch Belinda lift up a foot and move it's 'thumb' waggling it from up against her other toes to completely opposite of them, like the grasping claw of some birds.;
[status]               You were so surprised by the range of motion that you didn't notice the increase in length, while not as long as the other toes the 'thumbs' of her feet, you'd say that, they appear to be about three quarters in size.;
[short]               digigrade grasping feet;
[tgShade]            feet 78;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               As you watch, Belinda's toe nails fall off, and all her toes thicken.;
[status]               Belinda's feet have become thicker, the 'thumbs' of her feet changing position as she needs.;
[short]               blunt digigrade grasping feet;
[tgShade]            feet 87;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               Through the $CUSTOM5$ on Belinda's feet you can see ebony claws begin to curl out, the claws on what would be the 'pointer' and 'thumb' of each foot if they were hands are growing particularly large and curved.;
[status]               Belinda's feet, like the rest of her, is looking increasingly inhuman, moreso then they already were.;
[short]               clawed, grasping, digigrade feet;
[tgShade]            feet 96;
[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               Combined with her $CUSTOM5$, with a flex Belinda's feet take on their final, draconic cast. You try not to remember that it's her grasping claws breaking through the floor that drew your attention.;
[status]               Belinda's feet are distinctly inhuman, are very dangerous, and very fitting for the dragoness she's become.;
[short]               digigrade draconic feet;
[tgShade]            feet 100;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               David's mind is unchanged.;
[short]               bored mind;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               David shakes his head as he loses again, "Foolish, too foolish."

As the next round begins, it looks like he's starting to care more about the game.;
[status]               David has a more determined mindset.;
[short]               more determined mind;
[WaitFor]           face 3;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               David gives another shake of his head ruffling his $HAIR$ as he does so, even more determined to win, but something behind you keeps catching his attention, between the rounds you take a look at what it is, a kid in the back playing with a toy dragon.;
[status]               David has a determined, but yet distracted mind.;
[short]               determined but distracted mind;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               David closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. You wonder why, besides his loses, that he needs to calm down as you catch him looking over the audience.;
[status]               David is more distracted;
[short]               distracted mind;
[tgShade]            mind 5;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               David continues looking over the audience, you realize he's lingering longer on those who look healthiest, and/or most attractive, regardless of gender, including you. You suspect that the game's tendency towards... amorous behaviour is kicking in.;
[status]               David is visibly distracted.;
[short]               distracted mind;
[tgShade]            mind 13;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Where you'd expect David to curse another loss, he instead blinks, and smiles, as if he's solved an old problem.;
[status]               David's still easily distracted but his answers to intellectual questions is still fast.;
[short]               distracted but intelligent mind;
[tgShade]            mind 41;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               While most contestants are bemoaning their fates or denying their changes at this point, David just has been becoming more confident and self assured, enough so that you question whether or not he's trying to win anymore. The announcer asking him a question catches your attention, "David, are you paying attention?"     He looks at the announcer with annoyance, "My name, is not David. Not anymore! Call me, Belinda.";
[status]               David has changed his name to Belinda, you wonder what he knows that you don't.;

[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               You notice that Belinda is becoming less and less distracted by the audience, however, instead of refocusing on the game she increasingly seems interested in you.;
[status]               Belinda's focus is on you and not the game, despite this making things easier for you, you aren't sure this really is to your advantage.;
[short]               inappropriately focused mind;
[tgShade]            mind 61;
[WaitFor]           face 7;
[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               Belinda's predatory attention continues to focus on you, uncaring of the game or the audience, though she doesn't stall things despite the inattention. She also appears to be unconcerned about the damage to her admittedly ill-fitting, in form and fashion clothes.;
[status]               Belinda's mind isn't in the game, but it's certainly focused on you.

You don't know what her game is, but you're starting to get worried about what it is.;

[STAGE] 9;
[tf]               You realize that Belinda's game isn't a game, it's a hunt, and it looks like it maybe for you.;
[status]               Belinda licks her lips, staring at you like she wants to eat you, perhaps in more ways then one.;

[status]               David's hands appear to be what you would expect for a librarian.;
[short]               average hands;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Despite being fairly soft for a mans hands, you can see David's hands soften further, with a few paper cuts that had been barely visible healing up completely.;
[status]               David's hands have healed and softened.;
[short]               softened, male hands;
[tgShade]            hands 15;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You watch as David's hands thin, though they don't lose length.;
[status]               You can't help but think David's hands are looking more feminine, though they could still just be the hands of an effeminate man.;
[short]               thin, soft hands;
[tgShade]            hands 30;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               While David grips his podium in frustration you can see the nails on his hands grow longer though retain their bitten look, his fingers gain a little length, making them relatively thinner.;
[status]               You can't say David's hands are masculine any more, but you can't really say they're feminine either.;
[short]               tomboyish;
[tgPoint]            hands;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               David's nails take on an ebony color, an odd color for nail paint.;
[status]               David's hands match his increasingly feminine form.;
[short]               ebony nailed tipped feminine hands;
[tgShade]            hands 56;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You're surprised to hear a creaking sound as Belinda clenches her podium, despite their thin feminine form, it's obvious that Belinda's hands are gaining strength.;
[status]               The evidence of Belinda's sudden inhuman strength is visible in the indents in her podium.;

[WaitFor]           mind 6;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Belinda's nails grow longer, the ebony color even as they grow, and curve?;
[status]               Belinda's fingernails look like claws, but are much too thin and blunt to used as such now.;
[short]               claw-like feminine hands.;
[tgShade]            hands 82;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               Belinda's claw like nails grow thicker and sharper, as her fingers gain a little length, width, and strength as she accidentally scythes her new claws into her podium.;
[status]               Belinda's new claws look dangerous, as the blue smoke of electrical damage caused by the severed wires in her podium show clearly.;
[short]               clawed feminine hands;
[tgShade]            hands 96;
[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               With a final bit of growth in her hands, including claws, and they reach a form that crosses a human hand with the forepaw of a feral beast.;
[status]               Covered in $CUSTOM5$, Belinda's hands retain their feminine beauty while also obviously displaying their strength and lethality of her claws.;

[short]               loose pleated brown pants;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               With the growth of his legs, his pants are a little too short, but changes to his legs seem to be making them fit better.;
[status]               Better fitting but short brown pants cover David's legs, you suspect that somewhere along the way he's going to lose them.;

[tf]               You watch as David removes his belt, that you didn't even notice.;
[status]               A second look makes you realize that his pants haven't fallen down, that they still catch on his $LEGS$ at his $WAIST$;
[short]               masculine brown pants on $LEGS$;
[WaitFor]           legs 4;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You watch as Belinda winces then reaches down towards her $GROIN$ you wonder why she does so now when so many changes occurred their before without reaction, only for you to realize that she's unzipping to loosen her brown pants, which are now just snug instead of painfully tight around her $WAIST$.;
[status]               Despite being opened wide, Belinda's pants cling tightly to her $WAIST$, you can't help but think they're doing better then her $SHIRT$. Her white briefs clear to see and stretched to breaking.;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               There's a snap as Belinda's briefs give way under her tight pants, causing her to curse and reach down to fish for them, giving you a glimpse at her $GROIN$ before she readjusts her pants.;
[status]               Belinda's pants barely hide her $GROIN$ and are stretched to capacity.;

[tf]               Belinda's pants have been giving her trouble for too long, with a growl she uses her $HANDS$ to shred them apart. You finally have a clear view of her $GROIN$ and $LEGS$;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               As David scratches idly at his groin, you realize that there should be something there, but considering the other changes he's gone through so far you're not surprised you don't see anything now.;
[status]               You are both glad and disappointed you didn't get  to see the change, or reaction of David towards this change... still, you have to wonder why this change occurred so quietly.;

[tf]               While you can't see it, you think there has been a change to Belinda's groin again as she shimmies side to side to try to get a better fit in her pants.;
[status]               It's obvious that Belinda doesn't have a male tool down there, her briefs leaving no room for that, but at the same time she certainly doesn't have a camel toe.;

[tf]               With her underwear gone, you now have a clear look at Belinda's hood, but not much else as her pants still hide most of her groin.;
[status]               You're actually a little surprised at how small Belinda's hood is, it's almost as if her clit isn't there.;

[tf]               Without the $PANTS$ that were her pants obscuring her groin you can clearly see that her genital slit was a little larger then normal for a human, and now as her hood disappears it only increases in length.;

[status]               Despite the self stimulation it's obvious Belinda isn't getting off, yet at least, as she pulls her hand away to continue playing.

As she spreads her slit open, you see the vaginal opening you expect, and another opening above you didn't.

Is there something moving in there?!;

[tf]               Another loss and you can see Belinda's genital slit begin to glisten even before she spreads it apart, carefully she lets one finger play in her vaginal opening, but the others play at the second opening, and now you're sure you see something move.;
[status]               As she coaxes it out, you stare as Belinda plays with both her vagina, and her penis, a pointed thing with a bulb, perhaps knot, at what you presume the base as it fully emerges, more for locking it out then in a mate.

The way she bends it down, gently, over her vaginal opening tells you that it, like a human penis, doesn't have a bone aiding it's erection, though her grimace when she starts to bend it too far suggests it's about as flexible.;

It's obvious the changes aren't lowering her confidence.;

[tf]               David's skin is losing blemishes you didn't realize were there, you're not sure but you think it's taking on a different tone as well.;
[status]               David's skin is healthier then it was before, but at the same time it no longer has the normal pink undertone of caucasian skin.;

[tf]               As you watch David's skin tones change further, as you watch the changes you can't help but think he, soon to be she, will be the envy of many who have trouble with their skin.;
[status]               David's skin has definitely taken on cool yellow asian skin tones, certainly fitting for the asian beauty he seems to be becoming, but still his $BODY$, $ARMS$, and $LEGS$ is muddying the waters.;

[tf]               As you watch Belinda's skin seems to be taking on a more, orange like? tone. You wonder if the game has given her a sunburn, as it looks like it's making her itchy again.;
[status]               Belinda's skin has reddened such that her skin is now a more orangish skintone, making you wonder if she's developed a sunburn.;

[tf]               Immediately after another loss Belinda starts scratching herself, "Stupid skin, does it have to itch now?" 

You're almost worried for her, with the way her skin has reddened.;
[status]               Belinda's skin has mostly reddened again, though where she's been idly scratching she's developed some white patches.;

[tf]               As Belinda starts scratching again after her loss with her skin going from red in most places to white you have to worry that she's hurting herself. As you watch where her $HANDS$ scratch you are surprised to see glints of shiny ruby red that you wouldn't be surprised if it had been blood if it had begun to run. 

You quickly realize why her skin has turned mostly white, it's because it's dead, she must be about to shed her old human skin.;
[status]               Belinda's skin looks dead, like that of a snake about to shed it's skin, ruby red something gleams from tears her scratching has left in the dead skin.;

[tf]               Idly Belinda's started tearing strips of her dead skin off, and somewhat unsurprisingly you notice that the ruby red you saw beneath was scales.

Still, of what you can see of the scales, they look quite pretty.;
[status]               Belinda's started peeling herself, revealing the fact that Belinda has, admittedly beautiful, ruby red scales growing beneath.;

[tf]               As the losing buzzer rings out for Belinda she just smirks, brushing off the last of her former human skin from her $SHOULDERS$ as one would dust, she then proceeds to grab some of the skin that had been trapped under her destroyed clothes and balls it up, using it to wipe off the rest like one would use a towelette to dry off, or in her case, polish her scales.;
[status]               Now clear of the dead human skin Belinda's scales practically shine under the stage light, ruby red and fine in texture, you're certain that many woman would love to have skin as smooth and flawless, even if it was as scales.;

[Desc]               <blue>Standing in front of you is Alphonse Beckiton, The host explains that he's an honour student, but missed a scholarship due to his abysmal gym grade. Now he's competing to gain the money for university. As you go up to shake his hand, you see how nervous he is, quivering before you even touch him. This should be a cinch.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <blue>The giant lizard man that used to be Alphonse Beckition yawns, showing all of his pearly white fangs. "Yo, host, when the fuck's this gonna be over, man? The bitches are calling, y'know?" After the host explains that the game is in fact over, and that he lost, Alphonse shoves them aside with the speed of a newspaper hitting a fly, and grabs a couple of girls in the audience who can't stop staring at his twin dicks. You hear him whisper "Mine" to one of the women, and half lead, half drags them off-stage, where you immediately hear groans and moans of bliss. Looking back at Alphonse's new form, you doubt that this moment will be his last.</blue>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               When Alphonse does speak, it's in a quiet and nasally tone that you have to hold back laughter at.;
[short]               nasally quiet voice;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Alphonse lets out a large and gross cough, cleaning up the resulting phlegm with a hankerchief. He excuses himself, and you notice that his voice has gotten a bit deeper.;
[status]               Alphonse's voice may have deepened a bit, but its nasally tone is still present.;
[short]               deeper, nasally voice;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               As Alphonse starts to comment on the previous round, another coughs overtakes him, though not near as gross as the last one. After he recovers, you hear no nasally qualities in his voice. With that gone, and how deep it is now, it almost sounds a bit commanding.;
[status]               Now that none of that high pitched nasally tone is present in Alphonse's voice, it sound low and a little aggressive.;
[short]               low voice;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You actually see Alphonse's neck swell a bit as he coughs again, this time an almost ferocious growl. What startles you more than the cough is his voice, now loud, coarse, and dangerously deep. He cracks a smile at your bewilderment. "What? You didn't expect this voice from me? Well, sorry to disappoint.";
[status]               Alphonse has a loud and powerful voice that nearly shakes the podium you're on, and he's not afraid to show it off.;
[short]               low and booming voice;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               There's no coughing this time as Alphonse's voice grows deeper and raspier, until it sends vibrations through your feet. He licks his lips as he sees the effect his voice has on the audience.;
[status]               Alphonse has a rumbling voice that clearly suits the $FACE$ it comes from. It has a slight hiss on some words that send a chill up your spine.;
[short]               low, rumbling voice;
[WaitFor]           face 4;

[SHOULDERS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Alphonse's shoulders nearly touch each other with how slouched they are.;
[short]               hunched over shoulders;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You hear the ugly grinding of bone as Alphonse's shoulder gain a little more width, although it might be because he's no longer slouching. Sure enough, he attempts that posture again, then stands up straight with a tired exhale, commenting that it "doesn't feel comfortable anymore, for some reason." You think you know the reason.;
[status]               Alphonse has a shoulder span that is a little below someone of his height would have, but it's a far cry from the slouched position he came in with.;
[short]               below average shoulders;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               That gross sound of bones shifting overcomes the room again, and you wonder how painful it is to Alphonse if it's this painful to your ears. However painful it may be, Alphonse doesn't seem to notice as his shoulder span increases again, now broad and proud.;
[status]               Alphonse has very broad shoulders that he doesn't make a big deal of.;
[short]               broad shoulders;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Alphonse's shoulders nearly double in width, giving him the look that even a football player would hide in shame of. He smirks as bulges grow on the sides of his neck, his trap muscles forming visible veins from how big they're getting.;
[status]               Alphonse has the shoulder width of the front of a bus, with traps so huge that you've ever seen them on roided out bodybuilders, although you have the feeling that his are completely natural.;
[short]               massive shoulders;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               If you looked up "dweeb" in the dictionary, you're sure that you'd find Alphonse's $FACE$ front and center. He mumbles to himself frequently, trying very hard not to look anyone in the eye. Despite this, he has an air of intelligence about him, as his eyes are constantly surveying the environment.;
[short]               dweeby nerdy mind;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               With all the changes going on, Alphonse's mind must surely be panicking. He looks at his altered body in fear, before suddenly straightening up and looking you in the eye. "It's okay. I've got this.";
[status]               Alphonse seems to have gotten a burst of confidence.;
[short]               strengthened, nerdy mind;
[WaitFor]           waist 1;
[WaitFor]           arms 1;
[WaitFor]           legs 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You hear a light "Fuck." coming from somewhere on the stage, and are shocked to find out that came from Alphonse. "I need to step my game up. All these losses are bullshit, man." He shakes his head as if to clear out the cobwebs, and continues playing.;
[status]               Something has changed in Alphonse's mind. He's gotten a tad more assertive, but it came with a hit to his intellect, as he's having more and more trouble with the rounds.;
[short]               assertive, slightly dim mind;
[WaitFor]           hair 2;
[WaitFor]           face 2;
[WaitFor]           voice 2;
[WaitFor]           butt 2;
[WaitFor]           hands 2;
[WaitFor]           groin 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               "Okay, that was fuckin' bullshit." You hear Alphonse burst out to the already weary host. "I TOTALLY got that one right! You saw it! It was right!!" The host takes time to calmly, but firmly, explain the previous round to Alphonse and how he got it wrong, but it looks like it's going in one ear and out the other. Finally Alphonse gets bored with the explanation. "Whatever, dude. You keep goin' with that 'questions' shit. It's not like I'm gettin' any badder from the changes, anyway." You beg to differ...;
[status]               Alphonse is now a total opposite of his nerdy persona. He's now loud, aggressive, and painfully dim.;
[short]               agressive, stupid mind;
[WaitFor]           shoulders 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               "Aw, fuck yeah. My plan worked." Wait, he was TRYING to lose? You don't have time to worry about that, though, as his $GROIN$ starts to harden even more. 'Yeah..." Alphonse mutters, his eyes glazed.;
[status]               Alphonse is starting to care less and less about the game, and more on his own libido.;
[short]               horny, stupid mind;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               It's been a couple of minutes since you won the round, and Alphonse hasn't moved an inch, his glossy eyes staring into space. The host timidly prods him to get the next round going, and nearly gets a claw for their efforts. Once Alphonse has calmed down, he settles down in his chair. "It's alright, dude. I've just been thinkin'... about bitches, you know? Like, I need to fuck soon, my cock's hard as a... it's fuckin' hard.";
[status]               Alphonse is a typical, stupid jock. He's completely given up on the game now, thinking only about sex.;
[short]               horny and jockish mind;
[WaitFor]           hands 3;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You can't see Alphonse's feet, but judging by his shoe size, they're quite small. You meanly joke to yourself on what that means for the rest of his anatomy...;
[short]               small feet;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Alphonse shifts his feet around as you see his shoes bulge out a bit. His feet must have grown inside them.;
[status]               Alphonse has average sized feet confined to his not-so-average sized $SHOES$.;
[short]               larger feet;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Alphonse's $SHOES$ start to tear apart as his feet grow even bigger in them. Judging by the distressed $FACE$ he is making, the feeling is quite painful.;
[status]               Alphonse has rather large feet, and they look like they'd strain any shoewear, let alone his own $SHOES$.;
[short]               large feet;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Alphonse's feet continue to lengthen to an inhuman size. As this happens, his toes spread out, their nails curving to become claws. When all is said and done, Alphonse has lizard feet to fit his $HANDS$.;
[status]               Alphonse has two lizard claws for feet, each foot decorated with long, sharp talons.;
[short]               clawed feet;
[WaitFor]           hands 3;
[WaitFor]           shoes 1;
[WaitFor]           body 4;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Alphonse has very small hands with even smaller fingers.;
[short]               small hands;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Alphonse's hands cramp up as they grow a tiny bit bigger, but are still pretty small. He rubs them together, still recovering from the pain.;
[status]               Even after their growth, Alphonse still has small hands.;
[short]               small hands;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Alphonse looks in horror as his hands grow into beefy mitts. "How am I going to type with these?!";
[status]               Alphonse has a hand span that looks to be a footlong. ;
[short]               big hands;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Alphonse frowns in disappointment as his fingers shrink a little, but this is only to prepare for the next change. His hands grow thick and leathery, and his fingernails elongate and sharpen into nasty claws. Alphonse spends a few seconds toying with his loss of his fingers' flexibility, but soon forgets the issue.;
[status]               Alphonse has two lizard claws that look like they could take down a steel door.;
[short]               sharp talons;
[WaitFor]           body 4;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Alphonse has on some wrinkly grey pants, and you wonder why he never bothered to iron them.;
[short]               wrinkly dress pants;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Alphonse's $LEGS$ have grown too large for his pants, and he rips them off like they were a pair of tearaway pants. After some consideration, he removes his boxers too, looking lustfully at his exposed $GROIN$.;
[status]               Alphonse has chosen not to wear pants, and the view of his $GROIN$ is making you uncomfortable.;
[short]               lack of pants;
[WaitFor]           groin 3;
[WaitFor]           legs 3;

[GROIN];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You don't know why, but you have a feeling that Alphonse has a very small dick.;
[short]               miniature dick;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You see a tiny bulge in Alphonse's $PANTS$. Either he's grown an erection, or his penis itself has grown. Alphonse looks down at it with suspicion.;
[status]               Alphonse now has a respectable package under his $PANTS$. Nothing special, but nothing to laugh at either.;
[short]               regular sized penis;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               The bulge in Alphonse's $PANTS$ grows again, and this time you can tell that it's an erection. Alphonse looks at it sheepishly. "Heh. Sorry about this. Of all the times to get aroused...";
[status]               Alphonse has an erection-shaped bulge inside his $PANTS$. Not that you're an expert in dick sizes, but you'd guess that it's around six inches in size.;
[short]               six inch erection;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Alphonse grunts as his penis grows even bigger, now stretching the front of his $PANTS$. He almost puts a hand down there, clearly with the intention of jerking it off, but he decides against it.;
[status]               Alphonse's dick now stretches the front of his $PANTS$, and is now big enough that you can see its entire shape from the outline it gives.;
[short]               large 10 inch cock;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Alphonse's dick, now fully exposed, grows to an almost humourous extent, now more than a foot in length. Something seems odd about it, though. It might be how his penis is tapered and redder than the rest of his $BODY$, or it might be because even after all of its growth, his balls are the same size, maybe even a little smaller.;
[status]               Alphonse has a swollen dick that's around 14 inches long, with a puddle of pre oozing from its peaked head. Despite the size of his cock, his testicles look a bit on the small side.;
[short]               engorged 14 inch cock;
[WaitFor]           pants 1;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Alphonse suddenly cums, the volume of semen completely covering his podium and washing away the rags of his long forgotten pants. When he's finally finished, he pats down his cock in horror. "Where the fuck did my balls go?! You fuckin' took them on me!!" You don't bother to tell Alphonse that they're most likely still there, just internally. Sure enough, Alphonse forgets about his "missing" balls and decides to play with his dick instead, now even bigger and with strange ridges.;
[status]               Alphonse now has a lizard's dick, red with bulbous ridges around its shaft with a pointed head. The sight of it without any testicles underneath is a strange one indeed.;
[short]               18 inch ball-less reptilian dick;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Alphonse lets out an uncharacteristically high moan as his penis starts to quiver, before bloodlessly splitting in two. Not only did they not lose any mass while doing this, they look to have grown even bigger, now two feet each. "Well, this'll make threesome rad.";
[status]               Alphonse has two penises under his $WAIST$. You think they're called hemipenes. Each one is two feet in length, bulbous, and constantly seeping precum. ;
[short]               twin 2 foot hemipenes;
[WaitFor]           body 4;

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You suspect that Alphonse could blow away in the wind. His 5'7 frame has no muscle, no fat, just skin and bones, the skin covering those bones a splotchy, scar-ridden white.;
[short]               thin 5'7 body with pasty skin;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You look at Alphonse with a bit of suspicion. Has he grown taller? Sure enough, Alphonse stumbles on the leg of a chair, apologizing to nobody as he does so. Not only that, but it looks like a bit of muscle has developed on his body.;
[status]               Alphonse stands at 5'9, with a small layering of muscle on him. He's still not used to his height, bumping into chairs and his own podium.;
[short]               slightly muscled 5'9 body;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Alphonse looks taller again, and you think he's grown another couple of inches. What stands out more is his skin, which is smooth and lacking any of the scars it had before.;
[status]               Alphonse has grown another three inches, and his skin is clear of any pockmarks.;
[short]               muscular 6 foot body;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Alphonse shoots up, gaining inch after inch until he stands at seven feet. "Hello down there." He says, laughing at his own joke. He fails to notice how rough and patchy his skin looks.;
[status]               His skin, however, looks coarse and dry, drooping like it could fall off at any second.;
[short]               giant 7 foot body with rough skin;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Alphonse starts to scratch his $ARMS$, first gently, then ravenously. As he scratches, an odd green surface starts to show on his arms. Now pleased with the outcome, he starts tearing off all of his loose skin, leaving him with shiny green scales. ;
[status]               Alphonse is a seven foot lizard man, with a rippling, shiny physique that bulges over his shiny green scales. Every now and then he flexes one of his $ARMS$ or $LEGS$, pleased with the reaction he gets.;
[short]               7 foot lizard body;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;

[SHOES];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Alphonse is wearing a pair of dirty loafers that look like they've been used for years.;
[short]               grimy loafers;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Alphonse's poor shoes can't take the pressure anymore, and burst, revealing his $FEET$. "Hmmph. Serves them right. Stupid shoes.";
[status]               Alphonse doesn't have on any footwear.;
[short]               bare feet;
[WaitFor]           feet 2;

[BREASTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Alphonse has a chest so thin that you can see his ribcage.;
[short]               thin chest;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               A very slight layer of muscle generates on Alphonse's chest. He grabs the collar of his $SHIRT$ in shock, patting his chest down worriedly.;
[status]               Alphonse has a thin layer of muscle under his shirt, just enough to cover his ribcage.;
[short]               slightly muscled chest;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               More muscle grows on Alphonse's chest, and his pecs are finally starting to show. He rubs one curiously, probably expecting them to blossom into breasts.;
[status]               Alphonse now has a pair of pecs on his chest.;
[short]               muscled chest with slight pectorals;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               With the increased shoulder width, Alphonse's chest grows again, with his pecs gaining more mass, while keeping their consistency so as to not look like breasts. You can see a slight smile on Alphonse's $FACE$ as he pokes one of his pecs.;
[status]               Alphonse's chest is now muscled and defined, with a nice V shape in the middle coming from his pectorals.;
[short]               muscly chest with defined pectorals;
[WaitFor]           shoulders 1;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               It seems like Alphonse's chest was waiting for his shirt to come off to gain its true shape, as his chest almost doubles in mass before your eyes. This time, Alphonse just chuckles as layer after layer of muscle builds on him. You're so taken aback by how large and powerful his chest now looks that you fail to notice that his nipples have disappeared.;
[status]               Alphonse has the upper body of a Greek God, and maybe even moreso. His pecs are rippling with muscle, and his chest heaves calmly, but dangerously, when he breathes.

[short]               beefy and burly chest;
[WaitFor]           shirt 2;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Alphonse's chest goes from "muscular" to "ridiculous". His pectoral muscles grow out to beyond human, and ridges start to form around his neck, showing that it somehow has gained as much muscle. As slack-jawed as you are, it seems to be not enough for Alphonse. "Hmmph. I need to work on my pecs. Shit's getting so flabby, they're turnin' into tits.;
[status]               Alphonse's pecs are about the size of your head, and his chest looks like you could press metal with it.;

[WaitFor]           mind 5;

[HAIR];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Alphonse clearly doesn't care about his hair. It is greasy, matted, and stringy, with strands flopped on his ears and eyes.;
[short]               disheveled black hair;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Alphonse's hair tidies up a bit, now combed and neat. You silently thank the game show for fixing such a mess, even if Alphonse doesn't notice.;
[status]               Alphonse's formerly disastrous hair has been cleaned and slicked back.;
[short]               slick and combed black hair;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Alphonse's hair cleans up even more, and shortens to go just above his ears. This time he does notice, and looks in the mirror longingly, almost as if he was going to cry. Did he actually LIKE his messy style???;
[status]               Alphonse's hair looks like he just came back from the barber, with a hairline that crosses his forehead and above his ears.;
[short]               clean cut short black hair;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Alphonse's hair shortens even more, now a buzzcut. He slides his hand across the top of his head, seemingly pleased with the change now.;
[status]               Alphonse has a very thinly shaved buzzcut atop his head.;
[short]               buzzcut;
[WaitFor]           face 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Alphonse suddenly throws his head in his $HANDS$, writhing in pain. After a couple of moans and a muffled "I swear I didn't drink last night...", he raises his head to show that not only his hair has vanished, but two nubs have grown on his forehead. He examines himself in the mirror, saddened at the loss of his hair, but pleased with his growing horns.;
[status]               Alphonse is now bald, and has the nubs of what appears to be growing horns.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Alphonse's eyes cross as his horns grow out even further, now curved and 6 inches long. He dotes upon them in the mirror with a feral grin, before an expression of fear crosses his $FACE$. "These aren't gonna get in the way of me eatin' pussy, right?";
[status]               Two long horns sprout out of Alphonse's forehead, curved, sharp, and dangerous.;
[short]               long curved horns;

[FACE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Alphonse has a long face (in both senses) with a big nose, chapped lips, and tons of acne, some of it scarred presumably from picking at them. The only thing that looks good on it is his warm brown eyes, but even them are covered up by cartoonishly large glasses.;
[short]               acne-ridden face with glasses;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Alphonse's glasses suddenly disappear. Blinking rapidly, he realises that he doesn't need them anymore.;
[status]               Alphonse's glasses have vanished, revealing his brown eyes.;
[short]               acne-ridden face;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               One by one, Alphonse's pimples disappear off his face. The way they vanish makes you a bit queasy, so you shield your eyes until all of his acne has been wiped away. Alphonse looks at his clean face in the mirror, touching with his $HANDS$ as if the mirror was playing a trick on him.;
[status]               While nothing whistle-worthy, Alphonse's face is now free of acne.;
[short]               clean and smooth looking face;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Alphonse grinds his teeth as his entire facial structure begins to change. His chin grows rough and rugged, his eyes shrink to beady points, and his nose grows to a fearsome size while not looking ugly on him. Alphonse spends a few minutes in the mirror, brushing his $HAIR back and enjoying his new looks.;
[status]               Alphonse's face looks like it wouldn't be amiss on a hefty lumberjack. His chin is angular and sharp, and his cheeks have deepened in, giving him a strong and admirable jawline. The only thing that looks out of place on him are his strangely yellow eyes.;
[short]               handsome and rugged face;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Alphonse lets out a bellowing cry in pain as his face morphs like plasticine. First, his jaw grows out of his face, enveloping his nose with it. His nostrils shift to either side of his growing snout, and his teeth turn pointy and fierce. The hair falls from his eyebrows, and a long pointed tongue snakes out of his mouth. When Alphonse finally opens his slitted eyes, his face has turned into one of a powerful and hungry lizard.;
[status]               Alphonse has a terrifying, draconic visage. His yellow eyes, while lacking intelligence, peer right through you, and you swear you can see smoke rising from his nostrils. His pointed teeth are always in a cocky grin.;

[SHIRT];

[status]               Alphonse wears a white buttoned shirt with a calculator in his pocket. Of course.;
[short]               buttoned shirt;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Alphonse looks like he's mulling over something in his $MIND$, before he finally decides on unbuttoning his shirt, strained from the growth of his $BREASTS$. You hear cheers and whistles from the audience, and Alphonse blushes at the attention, but you know he's enjoying it more than he keeps on...;
[status]               Alphonse has unbuttoned his shirt to show more of his $CHEST$.;

[tf]               You hear creaks and tears coming from Alphonse's punished shirt, rips starting to appear along its back. Alphonse sighs and with a flex of his $SHOULDERS$ tears the shirt in two. He looks over to the crowd to make sure everyone heard the loud rip his shirt created.;
[status]               Alphonse is shirtless, his $CHEST$ gleaming under the spotlights.;

[LEGS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Alphonse's legs are bony and weak, and have no hair on them, mimicking the rest of his $BODY$.;
[short]               weak legs;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Alphonse's legs start to bulk up a bit, now having enough muscle for him to not quiver as he stands. Alphonse looks down at them, confused. "Wait... aren't bad things supposed to happen when you lose? Is this the change?";
[status]               Alphonse has average legs, with only a bit of muscle covering them.;
[short]               average sized legs;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Alphonse stumbles a bit as his legs grow more muscle, now looking sinewy and powerful.;
[status]               Alphonse's legs look like he runs every day, and does some exercises while he's at it.;
[short]               sinewy legs;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Alphonse's leg not only grow more powerful muscles, but increase a little in height, making them ferocious, beastly chunks. ;
[status]               Alphonse has two legs that are smothered with muscle, and give the image of a bodybuilder who's taken one too many performance enhancing drugs.;
[short]               powerfully muscular legs;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               "Yes! Bring on more muscle!!" Alphonse can't help but shout as his legs bulk up to obscene proportions. You've never seen legs this large, and they look unnatural. Alphonse jumps on his podium for a while, the host too scared to tell him to stop.;
[status]               Alphonse certainly doesn't skip leg day. His legs are massive, heavy enough that you are surprised they don't dent the podium they're standing on. Not like he isn't trying, as he pounds his $FEET$ into the ground, pleased at how loud the stomp is.;
[short]               bulky and muscular legs.;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;

[WAIST];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Alphonse's waist is thin enough that it would look pretty good on a woman, but not quite as well on a man.;
[short]               twiglike waist;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Alphonse gains a bit of mass on his waist. He looks at it in despair. "That settles it. They're going to make me fat." He turns his $FACE$ away, and you think you hear sobbing.;
[status]               Alphonse looks to have gained a little weight on his belly, but you're not sure if it's fat or muscle.;
[short]               average sized waist;
[WaitFor]           butt 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Contrary to Alphonse's predictions, his waist smooths out a bit, and a faint outline of a sixpack appears. As time goes on, the outline grows more noticeable, until it is indeed a sixpack. Alphonse's mood isn't lightened by this development, though. "I hope I'm not going to become some meathead jock...";
[status]               Alphonse has a tough sixpack under his $SHIRT$.;
[short]               smooth waist with a defined sixpack;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Alphonse pounds his belly with fervor as his six pack somehow grows more abs. As they grow and harden, you wonder if they could be scaly plates instead, but as they flex with Alphonse's heavy breaths, you think it more likely to be muscle.;
[status]               Alphonse somehow has a ten-pack, each ab chiseled and tough. The symmetrical placement of them reminds you of armour, or perhaps more appropriately, scale mail.;

[short]               bony thin arms;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Alphonse's skinny arms start to fill out with a tiny bit of muscle. He's trying to hide his excitement with the change, but still puts his $HANDS$ in his pockets, attempting to just ignore it.;
[status]               You would never say that Alphonse's arms are muscular, but they look healthier than the twigs they were at the beginning of the show.;
[short]               healthy looking arms with a bit of muscle.;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Alphonse stares at his arms as they grow more muscle. There is a queasy look on his $FACE$, as if he is going to be sick. Still, he flexes one arm tentatively, just to see how much muscle really is on them.;
[status]               Alphonse's arms no longer look like they would break at slight pressure, and now look strong and sinewy. Alphonse is still weary of their changes.;
[short]               sinewy arms;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               It doesn't look like the muscles on his arms bother Alphonse anymore, as the biceps grow yet again, a smile forming on his $FACE$. "I could get used to this...";
[status]               Alphonse has the arms of a bodybuilder, maybe even larger. His arms are about the size of someone's legs, and have double the muscle.;
[short]               huge and brawny arms;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Alphonse gives out a low, dumb, chortle as his arms grow out to freakish proportions. His biceps and triceps bulge out with the excess muscle, now thick enough to uproot a tree. He flexes for the crowd, and veins pop out of his arms.;
[status]               Alphonse has tree trunk arms, strong enough to stop a train in its tracks. He occasionally shadow boxes, grinning as a whipping sound permeates the air with every punch.;

[status]               Since he's facing you, you can't see Alphonse's butt, but you know it's quite bony.;
[short]               bony butt;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Alphonse's butt grows out slightly, not even enough to fill out the seat of his $PANTS$. Alphonse looks back at it in apprehension. "Are the changes going to make me fat?";
[status]               Alphonse's butt has grown just enough to make it look normal for his $BODY$.;
[short]               average looking behind;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               As Alphonse's butt grows again, it's clear that the growth is not fat, but muscle. Alphonse isn't sure what to make of this, so he sits down, hiding his behind from the world.;
[status]               Alphonse has a butt that looks athletic and firm, as if he did a couple of squats a day.;

[status]               Alphonse has two powerful glutes that still look quite manly on him despite their size.;

[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               As Alphonse's ass grows yet again with muscle, a strange nub develops above it. Alphonse rubs it a bit, frowning in confusion, but soon leaves it alone.;
[status]               Not only did Alphonse's butt swell with muscle again, but a nub of bone has grown just above it.;

[WaitFor]           mind 4;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               The tiny nub above Alphonse's ass steadily grows until it's around three feet long, where it gains the same green scales as the rest of his $BODY$. Alphonse tests it out for a few minutes, whipping it around so fast that it knocks over a chair.;
[status]               Alphonse has two large buttcheeks that you know are completely made up of muscle. A long lizard tail sticks out from his butt, swaying lazily back and forth.;

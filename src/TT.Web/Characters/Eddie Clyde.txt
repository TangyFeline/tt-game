[Desc]               <blue>You are Eddie Clyde, and fuck anyone who remembers the name. Nicknamed "The Ruffian" by your crew, you're a master cat burglar, able to slip in and out with the goods in a minute. Well... you WERE a master cat burglar. That bastard rat Donoghue set you up, and now you're here for what they call "alternative punishment": win the game, and you go home. Sounds like a scam, and you know your scams, but fuck it. Not like you'd be getting this kinda entertainment in the SHU.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>Finally, the game is over. Not that it wasn't fun, but you're not great with performing in front of a crowd, for obvious reasons. At least people are rid of the mystique surrounding centaurs, and might be more willing to trust one wearing the badge like yourself. Thanking the host while choking back a moan, you canter offstage and into a bathroom stall for some much needed release. 

Life went on as usual from there. You got a hearty congrats from your squad, all of them graciously going quiet whenever the camera showed an up-close shot. You keep on nabbing crooks, writing paperwork, and fucking yourself raw on your pole. But you still can't find a true partner, someone who shares your lust for both the law and your loins. Finally, you meet a meek minotaur with a two footer in his pants... but that's a tale for another time.</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your voice is a bit worn from smoking. You'll never be a radio host, not like you'd ever want to be.;

[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               A strange tickle in your throat forces you to cough, and you notice that it doesn't sting your throat to do so. Sure enough, your throat has healed a bit, back to how you sounded before all the chainsmoking.;
[status]               Your voice still has a bit of a rasp, but it's far better than it was at the beginning of the game.;
[short]               healed voice;
[tgShade]            voice 25;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               There's that tickle in your throat again. You test it out, and instinctively put a hand to your mouth in shock. It's... it's awesome! Loud and commanding, just like what you've always wished it to be! In fact, you picture yourself giving out commands, until you realise that you sound like a cop. Heh, no thanks.;
[status]               Your voice has completely healed up, and with it came a powerful pitch. You've taken to showing it off whenever you can.;

[tgShade]            voice 50;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               "Your voice must be clear in order to properly enunciate procedure." While you're distracted by that thought, your throat tightens a bit, and you instinctively know that it is sharper, while still maintaining a civility.;
[status]               Your voice is something you're pretty sure you use daily in giving commands and talking to suspects. It has a high timbre, but that doesn't mean it's willowy, as it can shout down a runner like any other.;

[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               There's a tickle in your throat, and soon your pants grow heavier, your vocal cords loosening up. This ALWAYS seems to happen when you're in heat: As soon as your estrus hits, your voice goes down an octave.;
[status]               Your voice is clear and commanding, a godsend when on patrol. Unfortunately, your estrus lowers its pitch to a husky, almost seductive drawl. At least you're not a whinnier in bed...;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You're a thief. You don't mind saying it. Hell, let everyone know it, except for your targets. The world's a shithole of beaurocracy and lies, at least you're honest about your line of work. After you win this game, it's back on the streets, just the way you like it.;
[short]               sly and stubborn thief mind;
[tgShade]            mind 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               "Alternative punishment"... ha! Look at what your alternative punishment's given you! A killer $BODY$, some $ARMS$ and $LEGS$. Hell, even your ass looks good! A small but nagging thought hits you: were these changes intended for someone else? Heaven knows you don't deserve them... You shake yourself out of that thought quickly. Who the fuck cares if you deserve it?;
[status]               You are pleased with the way your 'punishment' is going, as it's done you nothing but good so far. So much so that you feel skeptical on if it's truly intended for you...;

[tgShade]            mind 12;
[WaitFor]           body 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Well, that must be the game! You've completed your transformation to a short ugly crook to a strong six footer. And come to think of it, the game WAS a sort of punishment, as you've been slowly gathering more and more guilt for what you've done. Clearing your throat, you address the crowd. "Hey, thanks for having me here. I'm... sorry for what I've done. And I'm not just saying that anymore. I don't know what this game's done to my head, but it's made me see how much I've been hurting people. I'm ready to change that." And yet, as you walk off the stage, the host stops you, informing you that the game's hardly begun. Wait, what?;
[status]               You are a changed man, in both body and mind. The game's changes have taught you a lesson on your crimes, and you're willing to rebuild... but the game's not over.;
[short]               reformed mind;

[WaitFor]           body 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You're about to scream. You're about to escape. You're about to run away from this horrible gameshow and never return. But as you open your mouth to curse the host out, you come down with a massive headache, your mind swirling from... papers. Papers upon papers fill your vision, and you strain yourself to read them all. "Lawful arrests need either a probable cause or an arrest warrant." "Treat a gun like it is loaded at all times." All these thoughts make you dizzy, even as your vision clears. What were you scared of again?;
[status]               You're certain that something is terribly wrong, but every time you try to collect your thoughts, they turn into more of your police protocol. Wait... YOUR police protocol??;
[short]               addled mind;
[tgShade]            mind 37;
[WaitFor]           groin 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               The notes and voices keep swirling around in your head, and you think you've got things figured out. This game is trying to turn you into a girl... or a boy. You're not sure which. You get the feeling they warned you about this beforehand, but it's a good image for officers to be a part of these kinds of things. Yeah... you're definitely a cop. But your sex, and even your name, is a mystery...;
[status]               This game is taking its toll on your mind, more than you realise. While you're certain that you're a cop, you're less certain about your gender and name. Maybe... female? That's just an educated guess.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Well, that's the game. You might have lost, but it wasn't the worst way to spend the day. Waving goodbye to the cameras, you walk off the stage... only to be stopped by the host. Apparently the game's not over yet... You awkwardly get back on the stage, trying to laugh off your blunder.;
[status]               You are Elle Clips, a policewoman (though the correct term is police officer...) whom joined this gameshow as a sort of charity event. Firm and focused, you take your job very seriously, even if it makes relationships harder. But you don't mind. The law comes first.;

[WaitFor]           body 3;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               You take stock of your body in horror. From your $BREASTS$, to your $BUTT$, to... whatever's going on between your $LEGS$, you look and feel like one of those stripper cops. Needless to say, it's getting to you, and you take a couple of deep breaths in order to calm down, thinking of a vast, open field...;
[status]               You're certain that the game is turning you into some sort of horrible bimbo, but you're still attempting to keep your cool... while distracting yourself from your $GROIN$.;

[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               So... this was unexpected. You came here as a cop (at least, that's what your mind tells you), and you're leaving as a... satyr? You vaguely recall learning about them in Greek Lit. But that thought is shattered and shredded by another powerful pulse of pleasure, making you weak in your horsey knees. And it doesn't go away... even when you give in and jill yourself off to completion, it's still as hot as ever. So high is your libido that it feels like it's scorching your mind... and that's exactly what it's doing.;
[status]               You're... Elle, right? Or was it Ellie? Doesn't fucking matter, since your fucking $GROIN$ is fucking fired up and FUCK!! You just nearly came thinking about it. Hard to be self-analytical when your cunt's decided it was Mount Vesuvius in a previous life.;

[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               There's a buzz in your mind, which is actually your libido burning off the rest of your human memories. You're now Ellie Equus, as you've been your whole life. And you're being recorded. Giving the snickering cameraman a look that says "I can break half of the bones in your body and leave the other half for the inmates", you try, try, try to not think about sex... which of course means you orgasm once again.;
[status]               You are Corporal Ellie Equus, a centaur working as a police officer in the city. Your equine body makes your work very easy, though it has a fatal flaw: you are constantly, miserably aroused. As such, it's difficult to read someone their rights when juices are trickling down your leg. Thankfully the force understands, and nobody mocks you for it- not after the last guy got a hoof-shaped hole in his chest. ;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your feet have saved your ass on dozens of occasions... well, barring the last one, of course. They're small for a man's, but with that size comes speed and stealth.;
[short]               quick feet;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You stumble, just for a second, but you've been agile enough all these years to know that something is up with your feet, or at least your balance.;
[status]               Something has happened to your feet, but you have no idea what it could be...;
[short]               seemingly changed feet;
[tgShade]            feet 20;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               After a few seconds checking for any changes, you notice how much steadier you feel. Seems like your feet have readjusted to your stance, but it makes you a little nervous: why would they make you clumsier only to fix it? Somehow, you think that the changes weren't just skin deep.;
[status]               You think you've regained your steadiness that had been taken from you in the previous rounds... but why?;
[short]               steady feet;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               "Hey, I don't mean any disrespect. I'm just saying, it must be hard to get a proper size." You purse your lips. That asshole Frank. Who cares how big your feet are?? Wait... something seems wrong. You look down, only to see the same big feet you've always had. Huh... must have been nothing.;
[status]               You've got big feet, and everyone at the station seems to know it. Well, maybe not everyone, but it's been the target of conversation way too often.;

[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               At first, the pain in your feet is brushed off as them being sore. But soon they feel like their bones are crunching inwards, making you scream out in pain and distracting you from your $GROIN$. Slipping off a shoe, you recoil at the sight of your blackened foot, as if it was about to fall off from gangrene. ;
[status]               Your feet are discoloured and sore, and you're assuming the worst. ;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               All of a sudden, it feels like your feet are encased in rock, and when you look down at them, that isn't far from the truth. Watching with slack-jawed amazement, your feet contract and turn cylindrical, the blackness revealing itself as keratin. Hooves. You've got fucking hooves.;
[status]               Your hooves are nice enough, though they tend to get pretty messy after a hard day's work. You can't reach your $GROIN$ with them, and it humiliates you that you know this.;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your hands are scarred, calloused... and perfect. They're probably the best part on you, aside from your $MIND$, of course. They can be in and out of a purse in a second, able to throw a quick punch faster than a whip. The only problem with them is their fingerprints, but you can't really do anything about that besides wear gloves.;
[short]               spindly hands;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Here comes the change you've been dreading: your hands. After a bit of cramps, you flex them to find that they are indeed a bit less nimble. Even if your hands look far cleaner, it's still a low blow.;
[status]               Your hands look cleaner, sure, but they're also far less nimble than before.;
[short]               cleaner hands;
[tgShade]            hands 33;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               "All female police officers must have their nails trimmed to peek under the fingertips, no further." Before you can argue with yourself that you're not a woman, your nails grow out a bit... but are still acceptable for police protocol.;
[status]               Your hands look remarkably girly, even with their shorter nails.;
[short]               womanly hands;
[tgShade]            hands 66;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your hands twitch, and something inside you informs you that your hands are finished changing. But... then why don't they look any different? Same dainty shape, same calluses from work, same gloss on the nails... what changed, exactly?;
[status]               Your hands are a perfect combination of rough and feminine. Their structure is girly and dainty, yet their skin is coarse and tough from your job. And even though you hate the look, you put some gloss on your nails for the occasion.;

[PANTS];

[status]               You're wearing prison pants that are somehow both too loose and too tight. Goldilocks would have an aneurysm. ;

[tgShade]            pants 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your pants follow your $SHIRT$, turning a navy blue while also gaining a softer texture. You're not as peeved with this as you are your jumpsuit, since it looks like a pair of workpants. Quiet ones, too. No noise when the legs rub together.;
[status]               You wear a pair of nondescript work pants.;
[short]               navy blue work pants;

[WaitFor]           shirt 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your pants shrink up your $LEGS$, revealing far too much of them for your tastes. You shiver, feeling the cold air on your legs.;
[status]               Your pants are now shorts, hugging your $BUTT$ a little too tightly.;

[WaitFor]           butt 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Reflecting your $SHIRT$, your shorts change their fabric and look to show that they're police guideline shorts, not just a pair of jogging shorts. It's summer, so why not?;
[status]               You're wearing your favourite part of your uniform: your blue shorts. There's a lot of women on the force that decry that you're 'setting a bad example by revealing so much'. But seriously? They're shorts. You like wearing shorts. You don't need to fight the patriarchy with every action. Being a cop should be enough.;

[tf]               That's it. Fuck modesty, your pants have to go. Nearly tearing off your favourite shorts, you breathe a sigh of relief as your $GROIN$ hits the cold air.;
[status]               You don't wear any pants. Even if you somehow could wear them, you'd soak through them from how wet your $GROIN$ always is. Thankfully, you don't get fined for indecent exposure due to your $BODY$, but that doesn't make it less awkward to be naked all the time, like a feral animal...;

[status]               You've got an average dick. Nothing else to say about it, really. Not that it hasn't seen action, of course, but you can't remember your last relationship. Comes with the territory, you suppose.;

[tf]               Your suspicions are proved correct by the next change. You're definitely turning into a girl. Most assuredly. How do you know? You... you can't even bring yourself to think about it. Let's just say... you have a lot more room in your $PANTS$. And the most awkward thing is that it wasn't exactly painful.;
[status]               No sense beating around the bush, pun not intended. Your dick is at half size, looking like a figurine than a statue. Even your balls have shrunk, risen into your body.;

[tf]               First it's there, and now it's not. Before you can even realise it, your penis and testes poof out of existence, leaving behind a working virgin vagina, with all the bells and whistles. So you're a girl, huh? Yeah... you figured.;
[status]               Being a woman, you've got the parts to match, a shaved vagina that you rarely think about until it gives you problems. You're still a virgin, but that's only because you haven't found the right guy. It's NOT because your in love with your badge, no matter what your colleagues say.;

[tf]               As soon as you lose the round, there's a strange tingle that goes through your privates. At first, you blame it on an odd flash of arousal (not that you've ever had that happen so spontaneously...), but the more you think about it, the more you're confused. Maybe it's just a cramp.;
[status]               Your vagina is the same as ever, but there's an odd itch that you're pretty sure isn't your 'time of the month'. Probably a coincidence.;

[tf]               Did it just get hot in here? Fanning your $FACE$, you ask the host if there was a thermostat, but they just snicker. It's then that you realise it's not the room that's gotten warmer... it's you. And as soon as you think that, you feel a pang of what could only be arousal as your vaginal walls stretch, as if you thinking about it was all it needed.;
[status]               There's something terrible going on between your legs. You're far too aroused, and you could swear that your vagina runs deeper inside you...;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               OOF!! You feel like you've been punched in the abdomen, and you're not far off in that assumption, as your reproductive organs go into overdrive. You know exactly what the game is doing. Trying to make you play with yourself in public. But you're not going to give in... though the cameras won't notice a LITTLE touch, as you timidly slip a hand down your $PANTS$ to reveal... an oddly rubbery texture. Not that you notice, since you nearly orgasm from the very touch.;

The worst part is that aside from a well-used pole in your basement, you can't find a decent way to sate yourself, and you've learnt to steer clear from those who are excited to fuck a horse...;

Your vet says that the switch in species starts at where your human pelvis would be, and x-rays prove that to be true. It's an awesome form for chasing down perps, as chases last around thirty seconds, and people get scared off of threatening someone who could break their everything with a single kick.;

[status]               You're pretty pleased with your legs. Sure, they might be a bit too muscly, but you can chase down a perp like a racehorse, which has gotten you a bit of a reputation in the station.;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Ever since your $BUTT$ decided to take a pound of steroids, your legs were having trouble keeping balance. With that in mind, you almost feel grateful when your legs bulk up... until you hear two deafening CRACKS! Jumping back, you nearly fall down on your ass again as your legs bend unnaturally. And that's when it hits you: your knees have bent back.;
[status]               Your legs are... a mystery. Their musculature looks fine, albeit a little much for a woman. No, it's the fact that they bend the entirely wrong way. ;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               It's time. Somehow, you knew that your legs were incomplete. They bulk up once more, revealing themselves to be not human at all, but equine. You should be terrified of this... but you're distracted by how your thighs constrict your hungry $GROIN$.;
[status]               You have a pair of horse legs that look completely authentic, even without the hair.;

[tf]               Your two pairs of legs finally grow their fur out, covered in a roan hue. One of the strands of hair touches your $GROIN$, and thus you spend the next five minutes taking deep and frenzied breaths to calm yourself down.;
[status]               Your two sets of legs are hearty, burly, and very muscular. You can gallop at 25mph, and travel around 50 miles in a day. You're also fond of your roan coat that covers them. It's a bitch to trim your feathering, though. Thank God the force pays for your weekly vet visits.;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               A gurgle stemming from your stomach draws you to the faint lines of a sixpack that have shown up on it. And they said this would be a punishment...;
[status]               You stomach shows the barest hint of a sixpack, but you're certain it'll only get better as the game goes on.;

[tf]               Oof! It feels like you've been kicked in both side of your waist, reeling back. Looking down, you gulp as you see your new stomach, pinched inwards like you've been wearing a corset... or if you were a girl. Shaking that thought out of your head, you pull down your $SHIRT$ to cover it up, a blush on your $FACE$.;
[status]               Your stomach, while still toned, looks way too feminine for your tastes. It looks like the body of a fitness instructor. A girl one.;

No, it sounds like it came from your own mouth... and as you ponder this, you're only briefly aware of your stomach gaining more muscle, and your hips widening out...;
[status]               You have the lines of a six pack that your $MIND$ is claiming you work very hard to maintain, along with flared hips that could only be the hips of a woman.;

[tf]               You grunt as a sudden pressure fills your stomach, covering it in more layers of muscle, as well as a line of fur that leads to your... your THAT.;
[status]               Your waist is the conjoining point between your human half and your horse half, covered in a fine dusting of fur that thickens as it goes down. You sport a beefy sixpack, but no belly button.;

[tf]               At first, you whimper as you assume your $BUTT$ to be growing again. But the pressure only occurs on your tailbone, and a quick look reveals why. You now have a tiny tail. What, is the game turning you into a literal pig?!;
[status]               You have a tiny nub jutting out from above your $BUTT$.;

[status]               Your $BUTT$ has a swaying tail that shamefully swats it, as if it was killing flies. Of course, every spank sends rivulets of pleasure to your $GROIN$...;

[status]               Your arms have little muscle, and you don't keep much of it whenever you've tried working out. On the bright side, it's forced you to be more stealthy, as you aren't able to fall back on raw strength.;

[tf]               You feel that same twinge of discomfort in your arms, and you look on excitedly, waiting for more muscle. Alas, you only see them smooth out, leaving them hairless and a bit shiny.;
[status]               Though you haven't lost any muscle in your arms, they're not nearly as visible as before.;

[tf]               "Three sets, 20lb on each. Then 40 pushups before cardio." Even though your arms don't outwardly show it, you can feel them growing stronger, flexing them with pride. The only problem with them is how feminine they look, but even then, they're not... that bad.;
[status]               Your arms belie how strong they are, with their smooth and soft appearance. Lucky for you, they have quite a bit of power to them, able to deadlift 90lb on a good day.;

[tf]               You curse out the host as you feel the beginning of changes to your ass. They'll probably give you some stripper's butt! Thankfully, the opposite happens, as your glutes fill out not with fat, but muscle.;
[status]               You have an ass that looks pretty good on you, for a man's ass, of course. It's got enough muscle to keep a firm shape.;

[tf]               Your fears about the game giving you a stripper ass are proven correct as you feel your butt grow heavier, even if it doesn't look like anything's changed. You can only hope that it was muscle and not fat...;
[status]               Even if your butt still looks the same, you're certain it feels heavier, which isn't a good sign...;

It almost feels like you and them are good friends. At least she doesn't care about your rump. Catching yourself, you look down to see that it is indeed bigger, a little large even for a woman.;
[status]               Your butt is perky and somewhat plump. You get the odd feeling that it's a source of contention with the perps...;

[tf]               There's a strange pressure in the seat of your $PANTS$, and you know exactly what it is. Your stupid ass is straining them again. Completely oblivious to the fact that it wasn't as big a few rounds ago, you rub your rump in embarrassment. Not something you want yourself to be known for, that's for sure...;
[status]               Your ass is your main enemy. Forget the perps, THIS is what you strive to beat. No matter what kind of exercises you do or what food you eat, your ass stays round, bouncy, and plump. Needless to say, the crooks get a kick out of it. You? Not so much.;

[tf]               No... it can't be... you turn around in a panic, looking at your backside in the mirror. Your larger backside. Is this some sort of cruel joke?! Did the game think your ass wasn't big enough already?! While flames of fear and rage sear your mind, you keep a straight face. You've been in far worse situations than this.;
[status]               Your already big butt is now bigger, drooping in a way that showcases its curvature. You don't care how good it looks, you don't want it.;

[tf]               You suddenly lose your balance, landing on... something. It couldn't be your ass, since you can barely feel it. Unless... you look behind you, and scream. Not only has your ass grown, it's grown MASSIVE, looking more like the butt of livestock than anything resembling a human, especially with how muscly it is. Straining both your $LEGS$ and your confidence, you stand back up.;
[status]               A few rounds ago, your ass was massive, but still human-sized. Not so with your current ass. It's bordering on freakish, even if most of the mass is steely muscle.;

[tf]               Your ass starts growing out to fit its horsey body, becoming thick and plump. Thick... and plump... and juicy... Another pang of pleasure hits, and you instinctively heave your ass in the air, before shamefully putting it back down. Fuckin' lordosis...;
[status]               You have the ass of a horse, literally. It always seems to be the first thing people look at when first meeting you, not that you can blame them, you suppose. Though it somehow shocks everyone that you're not into anal. You explain it as your $GROIN$ getting jealous... and also that you're not THAT desperate. Nobody seems to believe the latter half.;

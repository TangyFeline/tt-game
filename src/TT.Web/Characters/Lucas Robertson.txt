[Desc]               <blue>You are Lucas Robertson... unfortunately. It's not that your life is a miserable one, since you have a well paying job at your father's mattress store, and a couple of close friends. Even so, you're sick of the monotony. In a way, the fact that your life isn't miserable, makes it miserable, since you know that so many people have got it worse, and they're not complaining. This is what led you to this game show, with its fancy and colourful ads promising to "Change Your Life- For Better or Worse!!". You know the risks, you've heard the horror stories, but you don't care. You want a change.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>The game is over, not that you care. You know who really won. With a sudden pounce, you bolt at the audience. Who you don't fuck, you kill, and who you don't kill, you fuck. Soon there are a couple of dozen howling shewolves, with a couple dozen more carcasses. You take the building, then set your sights on the city, bounding down the highway as you fuck whoever, and whatever. This probably wasn't the change you had in mind when you entered the competition, but right now, you couldn't give a damn.</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You're the kind of guy who doesn't really like the sound of his own voice, but you don't think there's anything wrong with it. It has a low timbre that came from your dad, but is approachable enough not to be intimidated by it. The only complaint you've been given on it is to speak up at drivethroughs.;
[short]               low, unassuming voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You suddenly cough wildly. Gross, a bug must have got in your throat. After a few minutes of wheezing (and some paramedics observing from a distance), you finally clear your throat, but you still have a strange rasp to your voice. It makes it even harder to hear what you're saying, so you compensate by speaking louder.;
[status]               After that bug incident, you find yourself talking louder to get yourself heard. It's a bit embarassing, but not nearly as swallowing a bug.;
[short]               louder, raspier voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               There's another horrible pressure in your throat, and you know that you couldn't have swallowed 2 bugs in a row. After the coughing fit, however, you find that your voice has lost its raspiness, becoming clearer. When you try to lower your voice back, you find that it takes considerably more effort. Defeated, you settle with your new volume. At least you got the louder voice you wished for. ;
[status]               The second change to your voice has left you speaking louder and clearer, while removing that rasp you previously had. You're trying to stay positive with this new change.;
[short]               louder, clearer voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You catch the upcoming change to your throat just in time, coughing into the sleeve of your $SHIRT$. Curiously testing out your voice, you find that while it's louder, it has lost some of its deepness. You shrug your shoulders and carry on. After all, your voice was a little too deep.;
[status]               Your voice's volume has increased again, but with it comes a higher vocal register. This somehow doesn't bother you that much.;
[short]               loud and confident contralto;
[tgShade]            voice 33;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You don't hide your cough this time, making sure that everyone hears that your voice is about to change. Testing it out reveals not an increase in pitch or volume, but a slightly haughtier tone that more closely resembles what you're thinking in your $MIND$. You test out some words and phrases, first some tongue twisters, then some lewd remarks, and finally some commands. You like the sound of the last few phrases best.;
[status]               Your voice hasn't gotten any louder, but is now a more commanding presence. You feel like you could tell ANYONE what to do in this new voice. ;
[short]               loud and commanding tone;
[tgShade]            voice 66;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               For the first time in the match, you don't feel like coughing before a change to your voice. Instead, there's a strange pressure behind your $BREASTS$, something that feels like it should be let out. Without thinking, you throw your head back and let out a bloodcurdling howl! After a few seconds to compose yourself, you gaze around at the audience, trying to pick out the ones that are quivering in their seats. They'll be the easiest to persuade...;
[status]               You have a loud and dominating voice, and alongside that, an innate knowledge of wolf communication. You switch back in forth between the two, after all, humans respond better to commands in their language.;
[short]               dangerous, growling voice;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;
[WaitFor]           face 4;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Let's face it, you're not exactly the life of the party. The most daring thing you remember doing last is referring to yourself as "Luke" instead of "Lucas", and even that only lasted a couple of hours. All that said, you're not depressed or anything. You just want a change, something that this gameshow advertises.;
[short]               normal, average-joe personality;
[tgShade]            mind 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There's a strange buzz that fills you. After shaking it off, you somehow feel more sure of yourself. You can't pinpoint any reason, or even why you feel like this in the first place, but you do feel it. Maybe this is the change that they were talking about. ;
[status]               You feel roughly the same, except for being a bit more confident. Perhaps this is all you needed. You should try to go home now. ;
[short]               slightly more assertive mind;
[tgShade]            mind 20;
[WaitFor]           hair 2;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Another buzz fills your mind, filling you now with energy. Your heart feels like it's beating a mile a minute! You pace around the podium, waiting for the next turn, and nearly snap at the host when they tell you that it's beginning. Whoa! Where did that come from?;
[status]               You feel full of energy, but that's also given you a bit more of an aggressive personality. You no longer feel the need to please anyone, in fact THEY should please YOU. You're no longer afraid of any changes. Let'em come.;
[short]               brash and energetic mind;
[tgShade]            mind 40;
[WaitFor]           voice 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               There's another tingle within your mind, and you start to wonder why you're even here. After all, you could beat up any of these punks in the audience, and they think you'll lose against the wimp in the podium next to you?! Oh the things you would do to change their minds... Your daydream starts off with you punching them, then tearing them to shreds, then straight up fucking them... You snap out of it just in time for the next round, catching a bit of drool on your mouth..;
[status]               Your already aggressive mind has turned to more primal urges. You rub your $GROIN$ while staring right in the eyes of an effeminate looking boy, licking your lips, without even realising that your sexual preferences have changed. Who cares if you might be gay? Who cares if what you're doing is 'indecent'? Who cares if you're being filmed? You're gonna get what you want. Now.;
[short]               aggressive, feral mind;
[tgShade]            mind 60;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               The arousal pooling from your $GROIN$ makes you almost miss the familiar buzz in your brain, but upon feeling it, you become MUCH hornier. As in, you'll pass out if you don't fuck someone RIGHT NOW. You hear the host drone on about decency, but a quick attempt of a bite is all you need to scare them off. A shame. You can smell his dick...;
[status]               You almost cannot control yourself from how horny you've become. Whenever the host, or your opponent, or anyone else draws near, you steel yourself away from grabbing them by the scruff of your neck and fucking them raw. They better hope that the game ends soon, or you might 'accidentally' lose control.;
[short]               perverted and aggressive mind;
[tgShade]            mind 80;
[WaitFor]           groin 3;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You look around the audience hungrily, awaiting your next move. There's a cute little guy on the right end that hasn't stopped looking at your $BUTT$. There's that blushing girl in the middle of the crowd, looking ready to faint right there. She could be an easy fuck. There's that black-haired guy up in the front, with a straining hardon and a shirt that looks like it's advertising some stupid mattress store. "Yeah, we won't need a bed for what I have in mind..." It takes the host nearly shouting in your ear to wake you up, and with that, you instantly know who your first meal will be...;
[status]               You are the shewolf Luca Pawsneak, although the last name is just a formality. Hungry and wide-eyed, you gaze around looking for some action, any kind. You certainly have enough mates to choose from.;
[short]               feral and sex-starved mind;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Being inside your $SHOES$, you can't see your feet. Not that you'd really want to. They're just feet. ;
[short]               normal, man-sized feet;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There's a painful pressure in your feet as they grow to fill out your $SHOES$. It really hurts, but you like your shoes too much to take them off.;
[status]               Your feet have grown, stretching your $SHOES$ a bit. It's a painful feeling, but you steer yourself away from the pain to protect your favourite footwear. ;
[short]               enlarged feet;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You wince as your feet grow again, this time enough to make little tears in your $SHOES$. You so want to take them off, to let your feet be free. But no, you can't. You have to protect your shoes... right?;
[status]               Your feet are now very big, maybe twice as big as the ones you came with. They seem to have gotten longer instead of wider, and the arch has thinned into a smaller, but still strong section. Basically, they look like big girl's feet. ;
[short]               painfully large feet;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               After taking off those STUPID shoes, you almost welcome the growth in your feet, as they elongate into a fiercesome pair. Looking down on them, you could swear that the bottoms have become rougher and darkened a bit, while your toes have gained sharper nails. No matter. You like how dangerous it looks.;
[status]               Now free from your shoes, your feet have grown into some monstrous shapes, with the nails becoming sharper. You wiggle your toes in satisfaction, although the action takes more effort than it usually does. ;
[short]               elongated feet with sharp nails;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[WaitFor]           shoes 1;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Like the rest of your $BODY$, your feet grow thick grey hair. As this happens, you get a pain almost like an ankle sprain as your toes become fatter, while the dark nails grow out into proper claws. When the changes are finally finished, you scuff your new paws on the floor, creating vicious marks in their wake. ;
[status]               Your feet may not have the same dexterity as your $HANDS$, but their claws might be a little sharper. Their form means that you can switch from a plantigrade to digitgrade stance as you please. ;

[WaitFor]           body 5;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your hands are pretty grimy, what with you moving mattresses all day. There are cuts and scars everywhere, with perpetual dirt under your short fingernails.;
[short]               Grubby hands with short, dirty fingernails;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your hands don't lose any of their scars, but the fingernails become cleaner. A small change, but a welcome one. ;
[status]               The only thing that's changed about your hands is your fingernails getting cleaned.;
[short]               grubby hands with short, clean fingernails;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               The changes to your nails don't stop at a manicure, as they grow out to a size that you're a bit uncomfortable with. They seem to be a bit sharper too, as you almost cut your thumb while looking at them.;
[status]               Still nothing has changed with your hands, but your fingernails have grown longer and sharper. ;
[short]               grubby hands with long nails;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You rejoice as your hands finally start to change, but only to grow a patch of hair on the backs. For once in the show, you're angry at how tame the changes are, clenching your hands into fists despite the sharpness of your nails nearly drawing blood. ;
[status]               The only thing different with your hands is now they are covered in hair. What a joke! While stewing over this, you fail to realise how much sharper your nails have become.;
[short]               hairy hands with thick nails;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Your hands start to stiffen as a strange leathery texture appears on your palms, while your fingers curl up a bit. This is finished by your nails growing yet again, becoming proper claws. They'll make it harder to play with yourself, but then again, they give you a new opportunity for fun...;
[status]               Your paws look dangerous, with claws extending inches from your fingers. Despite their pawlike shape and structure, they're actually more dextrous than they look. Maybe not enough to grip a pen, but more than dextrous enough to grip... something else.;
[short]               pawlike hands with thick claws;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[WaitFor]           body 5;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have on your casual jeans. Well... you say casual, but frankly, all of your jeans are casual. But these look, more casual? They have a mysterious stain that you wish that you caught before you wore them, as it's dangerously close to your groin area.;
[short]               casual blue jeans;
[tgShade]            pants 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Due to the growth of your $LEGS$, your pants have become rather uncomfortable. A bit sad that it had to come to this, you reluctantly pull apart some tears in the pant legs, making it a makeshift pair of shorts. At least your legs feel better.;
[status]               After your $LEGS$ have grown too much muscle to fit your pants, you tore off part of the legs to create some ratty shorts. ;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You growl in frustration. Your pants are still too tight! You claw at the seams, making one quick swipe that cuts off the pant legs altogether, unintentionally creating a pair of daisy dukes. Even though, you'd rather go naked, you're proud of your handiwork. Might as well give them a tease before showing the whole thing...;
[status]               You are sporting a pair of daisy dukes that you made when you tore off your pant legs. It fits tightly around your $BUTT$, and luckily sits right below your $CUSTOM1$. ;

[GROIN];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your dick is... your dick. You don't often study it in the mirror. It's hairy, and smelly, and... it's a dick. Perhaps the only interesting thing about it is its virginity, not that you care.;
[short]               unremarkable 5 inch penis;
[tgShade]            groin 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There's a strange pressure in your $PANTS$, and you look down to see a very distinct and dirty bulge down there. Cursing yourself for getting an erection with so many watching, you nontheless stand your ground, albeit with your $FACE$ beetred. ;
[status]               You have somehow grown an erection while playing. Although very embarrassing, at least you can hide it behind the podium. ;
[short]               erect 5 inch penis;
[tgShade]            groin 0;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You start to feel very hot, and contemplate asking the host to turn up the air conditioning. Before you do, you feel a strange wetness in your $PANTS$, and reach down to feel a spout of pre emanating from your penis. Even with this sensation, and even with the suspicion that your dick has gotten smaller, it takes a lot of effort to stop yourself from rubbing one off.;
[status]               Your dick has shrunk a tiny bit, but has become even more sensitive. You sheepishly try to hide the drop of precum in your $PANTS$. ;
[short]               aroused 4 inch penis;
[tgShade]            groin 25;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               This time, you can't help yourself, and plunge your $HANDS$ down your $PANTS$, jacking off until you feel the white hot heat of ejaculation. But rather than soothe your arousal, it only makes it harder, while your dick, ironically, has grown smaller. The changes are clearly linked, and you promise yourself not to do it again, although you know it's of no use. It takes a couple of minutes before you realise that you never once thought about the thousands of people watching...;
[status]               Even though your dick is puny, your arousal knows no bounds. Every time you assert to yourself that this will be the last time, you find your $HANDS$ clutching what is left of your penis and feeling a tiny drop of cum hit them, while your dick shrinks further. At this point you don't even care. ;
[short]               incredibly aroused micropenis;
[tgShade]            groin 50;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You've jerked off so much that your balls have receded into your abdomen, and your "dick" is the size of a bean. You no longer can grasp it anymore, instead rubbing it between the tips of your fingers. After what seems like the twentieth orgasm, you realise that you aren't feeling any semen on your $HANDS$, and subsequently, no more relief, however brief. Uh oh...;
[status]               You no longer cum after orgasms, and looking under your $PANTS$ you see nothing but a tiny nub. No matter how much you rub down there, you can't get no satisfaction, and you're getting hornier and hornier by the minute. For the love of God, just lose another round so you can cum!!;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You feel the floodgates literally and figuratively open as your groin blossoms into a vagina, the nub becoming an enlarged clit. While you're VERY thankful for the change, it seems that jilling off doesn't give you the same relief as before, and you paw your parts in wild lust.;
[status]               Your penis has officially turned into a vagina. Not that this bothers you in the slightest. What matters to you now is how to get some much needed RELEASE. ;

[tgShade]            groin 100;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               The arousal from your vagina is too much for you to bear. "HEAT", your woozy $MIND$ commands you. "MATE". Before you know it, you've leapt from your seat into the screaming audience in search for a "mate". You don't remember what happens next, only the sounds of pleading, screaming, and finally, moaning. When you come to, you're back on the stage with a couple of futuristic guns targeting your head and a very annoyed looking host whose reading out some bullshit rules about not "harming the audience". Scoffing at the speech, you turn your eyes to the remnants of the crowd, snickering wickedly as you spot a worn looking pantsless man scratching a rather hairy chest...;
[status]               Your pussy, like you, is hot and untamed. Even though you want to grasp at it so bad, you recognise that only another's touch can cool you off. At least it leaves them a gift as well, your eyes gazing over to the wimpering girly boy with the furry tits.;

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have always been taunted in middle school for your height. At 5'6, it's not exactly miniscule, but it's certainly not manly. You shudder at the memories of schoolyard taunts. ;

[tgShade]            body 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               All of a sudden, you notice that the host has grown smaller. Do the changes happen to people other than the contestants? When you question him about it, he just chuckles and points to the full-size mirror, where you realise to your embarrassment that it is you that has changed height, growing taller. Oops.;
[status]               After your gaffe with the host, you are now 5'7. Not a huge change, but maybe if you keep growing you'll have something to talk about. ;

[tgShade]            body 0;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You steady yourself as the host starts shrinking again, although this time you know better. You feel your skin grow a bit rougher, as well as some muscle in places you never thought could have muscle. You stretch out, enjoying your new height. ;
[status]               You have gained 3 inches, now standing a cool 5'9. Along with the height change, you've gained some visible muscle and definition. The only thing you're not wild about is how leathery your skin is, but you can deal with it. ;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You try to keep yourself from laughing as you feel tickles from everywhere on your body. When you calm yourself, you look at your body in delight as splotches of dark hair now covers most of your body. You finally got your body hair! Marveling over this, you gloss over another inch of height gained, as well as larger hips.;

[tf]               You gain more muscle and hair, the muscle visible to the cameras and the hair overpowering your body. It feels a bit wrong to have so much hair, as well as having such wide hips, but those thoughts are quickly forgotten about when you flex your new muscles. ;
[status]               You realise that beyond all the height, the bushy hair, and the muscly physique, your form looks more like a girl than a boy. It's a thought that you somehow can't bring yourself to worry about. ;

But a quiet voice in your head questions their true form, and an even quieter voice questions if you really care...;

A small part of you worries that they'll never stop growing, but you brush that thought away. So long as you keep getting stronger, who cares how big they get?;

[status]               You have massive breasts, probably an E cup, but since you don't wear a bra, you don't really care. They'd break your back if you didn't have such a strong one. You have a lighter crest of grey fur on your chest that points like an arrow towards the two prizes. ;

[tf]               You get a weird feeling that something has moved on your head, and looking at it in the mirror reveals the culprit. Your neatly styled hair has become messier, gaining a couple of inches as well. Luckily, you're prepared for this, digging out a comb from your $PANTS$ and brushing it back to its proper position. Much better. ;
[status]               Your hair was once rustled by the game, and grew a bit longer, but you took care of it with some careful combing.;

[status]               Your hair is now down to your shoulders, and is bushy and tangled. Somehow, you can't get up the energy to fix it, deciding to let it rest as it may.;

It also toughens up a bit, becoming more like a mane than a hairstyle. You shake your head back and forth to loosen it up, before grinning ferally at your new look.;
[status]               You have hair on your head in the same way that you have hair everywhere else. It's the longest of the bunch, and sits messily around your flicking ears. You sometimes shake your head a bit to keep that frayed look.;

[FACE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You sport an unremarkable face, all things considered. There's a bit of fat around your chin that is nonexistant elsewhere, and your blue eyes always look tired, probably because you ARE always tired. There's a bit of stubble that you didn't shave off, and there's some ugly acne scars from your bad habit of picking.;

[tf]               You feel a slight tingle on your face, and you slap your cheek, trying to catch a fly. No such luck, as you look in the mirror and see that your complexion has smoothed out, with all of your acne scars healed. Happy with the change, but still guilty about slapping yourself, you turn back to the game with one cheek red from the slap and the other from shame. ;
[status]               Your face's overall complexion has healed, and you now look like someone who uses those weird acne wipes every day. ;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You clench your jaw in pain as a loud grinding noise fills your ears. Once the pain stops, you immediately look in the mirror to see your new face. Parts of it have become more pronounced, such as your cheekbones and the bridge of your nose, while other parts have nearly disappeared, such as that disappointing bit of fat under your chin. It all creates the image of a man who knows that he's the best looking in the room, and while you don't feel comfortable in thinking that just yet, you certainly feel better about yourself.;
[status]               Your face is now one of magazine covers. You have defined cheekbones and piercing blue eyes. You smirk to yourself, enjoying the changes so far. ;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You can feel your face begin to change again, and you hurriedly rush to the mirror to watch. Any excess fat from your chin starts vanishing, and your face becomes slimmer overall. It's still not a bad looking face, but maybe a bit girlier than before.;
[status]               Your face has slimmed down to become a face that, while still handsome, isn't as striking as before. ;

[tf]               This round of face changes is the most severe. You grip your $HANDS$ to your head as you feel pain from everywhere on your head, from the inside of your skull to even the follicles of your $HAIR$. When you open your eyes, the world looks, different, brighter. As you head to the mirror, you are taken aback by the scope of your changes. Nearly everything has changed, from your wider nose, to your retracted cheekbones, to your pointed ears that are covered in fur. Your eyes are now slightly dilated, and glow a scary gold. You decide to ignore the changes for now. It's just too much to bear.;
[status]               There's been a lot of changes to your face. Along with looking very womanly, there have been some lupine qualities added, with glowing eyes and pointy, furred ears. While it was once terrifying, you are slowly growing used to the look.;

[tf]               A tickling feeling goes over your nose, and almost sneeze, but stop yourself as you look in the mirror. Your protruding nose has become black and wet, and you lick at it with your elongated tongue. A burst of senses come over you as your ears lengthen again, now able to hear what the arguing couple are talking about at the end of the room. You taste the sweet coppery taste of blood as your canines grow into menacing fangs. Finally, a light dusting of fur covers your face. You playfully snarl in the mirror, feeling wild, dominant, and most of all, hungry...;
[status]               Your face is bushy, snarling, and horny. Your ears twitch wildly as you listen to the murmurs of the crowd, all scared of you, as they should. Despite it's lupine nature, your face has just enough human qualities that it can display many emotions,although you prefer lust and hunger.;

[status]               You're still wearing your lucky shirt, and lucky indeed! It's given you a powerful rack! The now ripped up shirt is open to show off your $BREASTS$, while a white strip keeps them from bouncing all over the place.;

[tf]               The hair that has already formed on your $BODY$ starts to form around your arms, making them a dull grey colour. You flex your arms fearsomely, trying to catch the attention of a young lady who stared at them a little too long. She blushes and turns away, but you know she's already lost...;
[status]               Your arms are hairy and packed with muscle. You rub them with your $HANDS$, admiring how fit they are. Just the right amount of strength to carry a male above your head...;

[status]               You have a bit of a bony butt, which makes it difficult to sit down for extended periods of time. The only body hair you have is located inside your unmentionable cheeks.;

[tgShade]            butt 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You squeeze your asscheeks as you feel them grow some slight muscle. Turning around to look at it in the mirror, it certainly has some muscle, but not enough to make it bulky. You're happy with it the way it is.;
[status]               Your butt has grown just enough muscle to make sitting down in chairs easier. ;

[tf]               Your glutes feel worn out, as if you've been on a long run. Turning around to look at them in the mirror, you see them expand in your $PANTS$. You smack your newly enlarged butt and smirk at how it almost jiggles, before suddenly stopping when you flex it.;
[status]               Your butt has gained enough muscle to strain your $PANTS$, not that you really care. In fact, you're almost wishing for it to grow bigger.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your butt grows again, but this time you can feel it gaining some fat as well. At this point, you have stopped caring, but the sudden emptiness inside your anus makes you pause. It's a strange feeling that grows as time passes, but you manage to block it out. Somewhat. ;
[status]               Your butt now has an even distribution of fat and muscle. It is a far cry from the muscly behind you were hoping for, but you have other issues on your mind. Namely, how itchy the inside of your ass is.;

[tf]               Your ass grows yet again, and with it, an urge to fill it. You've now recognised that strange itch as arousal, but you have no way to satisfy it on your own. Looking out at the crowd, your grin widens as you see some proper contenders to "play" with. ;
[status]               Your butt is massive, packed with both fat and muscle. You constantly grip your cheeks, trying in vain to fulfill the emptiness it feels. ;

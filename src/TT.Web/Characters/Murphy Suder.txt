[Desc]               <blue>Stepping out on the stage is none other than yours truly, Murphy Suder. If you aren't caught up on your SC2 (or if you're one of those FILTHY console peasants...), you might not understand the importance of this. Murphy Suder, or Sudern_Death online, is a gaming master. Unmatched K/D, countless clips on Twitch, you're the cream of the crop when it comes to PC gaming. So what would make this any different? Sure, on the outside, you might be 'nerdy', with your specs and your slovenly clothing. But in your mind, you're a gaming god. </blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>So... that's it? {TRANSFORMANIA TIME TYPICALLY ENDS UPON THE COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION OF A CONTESTANT.} ...And that's yourself, right? {YES.} Huh. Humans are kivvin' weird. Then again, they probably haven't been in a Mendofian Drinking Game... but that's beside the point. From the looks on the audience's faces, they've never seen a Senerae before, either. Tall structure, purple skin, bouncy antennae, massive ass... okay, maybe that's just on you. But in any case, they all paint the picture of a big and horny alien. You feel a bit awkward standing in front of a crowd of humans like this, so you find the nearest exit and leave, without so much as a thank you.
Since then, life's been pretty constant. You had a bit of trouble beaming down a ship to leave Earth, but HQ got back to you pronto, for some reason acting like you were a 'new recruit'. Whatever. You're just happy to be back in the black, watching porn and eating rations. Your next delivery's 3 lightyears away, so you've got time for a bit of a marathon. And while flicking through the channels, you come across a particularly hairy dude rip off his sneakers to show off a beast's paws, his dick barely holding on as it shifts to a drooling twat. Ooh, this will be interesting indeed...

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               People have called your voice 'surprising', probably because it doesn't seem to belong to the $FACE$ it comes from. You have a loud and low voice, with clear diction. Of course, you don't tell people that the reason your voice is so clear is from the years of barking commands in Starcraft...;
[short]               low and powerful voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               "Shit!!" Oops... you were kinda in 'game mode' there, letting out a loud expletive as if you just got sniped by some camper. But something sounds off. You mutter under your breath, but for the life of you, you can't figure out what's different. It's MAYBE higher? But you can't really tell. Though from the smug look on the host's face, you're expecting the worst.;
[status]               You're pretty sure that your voice changed, but it sounds the same to your ears. if anything, it might have gotten higher.;
[short]               higher voice;
[tgShade]            voice 33;
[WaitFor]           hands 1;
[WaitFor]           groin 2;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               This time, you do feel the change to your voice, as your throat tightens up a bit. And when you mutter to yourself again, you definitely hear the change: your voice just got a bit lower. So maybe that last change was all in your head? Cuz why would the game raise your voice one round, and lower it the next? Of course, that's only half the story. True, your voice did lower, but it's nowhere near the pitch it once was. Partly due to the inflections you now have, your $MIND$ oblivious to them. They sound... feminine.;
[status]               Your voice hasn't changed. Surely, it hasn't changed. That high pitch it has only occurs when you're stressed, and the girly inflections are just happenstance. Nope, nothing's changed... you hope.;
[short]               slightly girly voice;
[tgShade]            voice 66;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Goddammit, another loss! You let your anger show, letting out a nasty blue streak that you only stop because you remember you're on TV. But that gives the game's changes enough time to tweak your voice so that all of its masculinity is scrubbed away- not that you noticed. You're still pissed about that shit performance last round.;
[status]               You quite like your voice, as many people who've heard you curse on the courts can attest. Sure, SOME people call it 'manly'... but that's just because they've never heard a woman like you swear like a sailor.;
[short]               confident woman's tone;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[WaitFor]           face 4;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Again you curse as you lose yet another round. But this time, something's off. You scrunch up your brow, muttering words to yourself in an attempt to figure out what's wrong, but you just can't place it. Your inflections are all weird, and there's an odd low timbre to your voice. It's almost like some unknown accent. {SENERAEN IS THE PRIMARY LANGUAGE OF THE SENERAE SPECIES.} Shut up. Not helping.;
[status]               Something about your voice is uncannily different, but you don't know what, and that voice in your head isn't helping, talking about 'Seneraen' as if that means anything at all.;
[short]               lower voice with odd accent;
[WaitFor]           mind 6;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Your throat twitches, vibrates... and closes up. At first, it feels like you're choking-- perhaps something in the atmosphere of this planet-- but you can speak just fine... just not in any language native to Earth. {LANGUAGE DISCREPANCY DETECTED}. your implant chimes. {LOCATING PRIMARY LANGUAGE OF >Earth<... >Mandarin Chinese< FOUND.} So much for that, since nobody here seems to understand the greeting you give out. Your implant corrects it to another language, 'English', and it looks like that's the proper language here. ;
[status]               As a Senerae, you speak perfect S'‘‘, as well as some 3.503 you picked up on the job. Your voice is low and harmonious, speaking in three separate tones found in your native tongue. Seems like that's not a spoken language here on Earth, so your implant's translating as best as it can. Weird language, though. Way too many syllables...;
[short]               low and foreign tongue;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[WaitFor]           mind 8;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Despite a lot of the time going sockless, you don't think much about your feet. You're, uh... happy to have them? But other than that, they're just feet.;
[short]               average feet;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You shuffle your weight on your feet, thinking that they've grown numb from standing on them too much. As it turns out, the numbness was just another change, as you notice how your $SHOES$ aren't conforming to your feet as much as they were before.;
[status]               Your feet feel smaller now, and they fit a bit better in your new $SHOES$.;
[short]               smaller feet;
[tgShade]            feet 50;
[WaitFor]           shoes 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You groan, a bit miffed with yourself, and begin to pace. With every step, a bit of energy flows into you, and soon your pacing has picked up into a light jog as your feet silently shift into a pair of nimble woman's feet.;
[status]               You've got a pair of nimble feet from years of tennis. ;
[short]               woman's feet;
[tgShade]            feet 100;
[WaitFor]           legs 3;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               It's like a magic trick: first your pinkie toes are there, and then they're gone. Thankfully, it doesn't look weird-- to you, at least. Your shoes feel much more spacious with the loss of that toe, however... hopefully you can pick up some new ones. There has to be a Globomart on this planet, right?;
[status]               You've got smaller feet than most Senerae you've met, though there WAS that foot growth trend a few years ago. Good thing you were out in the black, then. Other than their size, your feet are perfectly normal-- eight toes and all.;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You are Murphy Suder, pretty much the bonjwa of Transformania Time. Well, you WILL be, once you win this game like you do all your campaigns. Your K/D ratio is second to none, and you can't remember the last time you got seriously tilted. Outside of the computer, however... you aren't that special, looks-wise. But hey, that's what this game's for, right?;
[short]               nerdy and focused mind;
[tgShade]            mind 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You should be pleased with how things are going. You should be grateful for how tame the changes have been so far. But you've seen how this game works. Pride cometh before the fall, and even though you welcome the change in physique, there's still some things that raise red flags. Why did the game take your pubes? Why does your hair smell like cinnamon, of all things? And why did you lose fat everywhere except your pecs...?;
[status]               You've started to get a bit worried about the changes. Granted, none of them have been particularly bad, but that's just how this game works, so the player doesn't complain when he's traded in his D card. On the bright side, you haven't had any mental changes yet. Those are the ones you're the most worried about...;
[short]               paranoid mind;

[WaitFor]           butt 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Welp... you called it. Your thinner face, your broader hips, that damn thong... the game's turning you into a girl. Hell, your dick's probably smaller too, though you don't really wanna check that right now. As much as you're scared of this game's outcome, you can't help but feel a bit smug. You called it after, what, ten or so changes?;
[status]               It's clear you're turning more female with every loss, and yet you're a bit pleased with yourself for 'calling it'. At least now you know what you're up against... and maybe this'll light a fire under you to come up on top.;

[WaitFor]           pants 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Okay... quick checkup. Your butt's definitely bigger. You're pretty sure your voice is a bit higher. And your $LEGS$ look pretty darn womanly. But other than that... what's changed, exactly? Your dick's still there, your pecs still look like pecs... maybe you're just getting sporty? That'd be nice, actually. It'd get you out of that basement. A twinge of confusion spreads on your $FACE$ for a moment at that thought. Something about that doesn't seem right... eh, probably nothing. You check your nails, pacing as you wait for the next round. Should be a piece of cake.;
[status]               You've actually been pretty lucky with the changes so far. The game's making you nice and toned, and even more feminine areas like your $BUTT$ at least look healthy. You've also been given a decent amount of energy, though that might just be adrenaline. What were you worried about, again?;
[short]               confident, slightly feminine mind;
[tgShade]            mind 75;
[WaitFor]           butt 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               It's... pretty official, right? You're a girl. Well, a woman. The lack of dick kinda gives it away. And yet, you don't feel like anything's lost. Sure, you remember being a man (though it feels so weird to think on now...), but to be fair, he was a bit of a loser. Always in that damn basement playing... what are they called? MMOs? The O stands for Online, surely. But... you shake your head. Doesn't matter. What matters is you, and your 'new' life. Already, new memories are pouring in, and you welcome them with open arms. For instance, you've got a new name! Melita. Nice. Rolls off the tongue.;
[status]               You are Melita Boosalis, a young woman from Crete, though you moved to America last year. At least, that's what you ASSUME happened. You can still remember bits and pieces of some nerd named Murphy, and he's probably the 'real' you... but who cares? With every round, this 'other' life seems more real. And it's definitely better than being some speckled loser who plays computer games all day. Aside from Wii Sports, you don't think you've ever played one.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Fine, you'll admit it: you lost that last round entirely because of your $GROIN$. It seems to be constantly clawing at your mind. If only you could get some release. You'd ask for a bathroom break, but that'd just bring MORE attention to it. So yeah, it's not helping you with the rounds. That, and a weird buzzing that won't go away. It almost sounds... electric.;
[status]               It's been a rough couple of rounds, between the buzzing in your brain and the tingle of your crotch. Whenever you try to tap into that buzzing, you almost get 'pushed back', in a sense. Like the buzzing is sentient, and is telling you, "Not ready. Not yet." Are you going crazy? Maybe you DO need a good fuck...;

[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               That FUCKING BUZZING! It's worse than your clit! You grasp your head in your $HANDS$, the buzzing turning into a crippling wave of static... and then three strangely familiar tones play in your mind. {‘‘‘‘‘‘‘EBOOTING. SYSTEM ONLINE.

FALSE MEMORY DETECTED ON >Wikipedia<. RESTORE MINDSET?} You sigh, rolling your eyes. Sure, whatever. And just like that, your head gets a little emptier...;
[status]               You've got... well, you don't know HOW to describe what you currently have. {EXTRANET IS A MULTIPLANETARY, INTERGALACTIC SYSTEM OF INTERCONNECTED COMPUTER NETWORKS THAT LINK DEVICES ON A UNIVERSE-SCALE LEVEL.

[WaitFor]           groin 6;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               This... this is all too much. Your $BUTT$, your $BREASTS$, your $BODY$... you can barely recognize yourself now. Your mind starts to shut down in desperation as you close your eyes, prodding yourself in order to wake up from this dream... okay, that's not a prod. And if it is, it's in a VERY naughty place. Indeed, you find yourself jilling off in a strange attempt to regain your sanity. And the strangest thing is... it works. Once you've cum, your mind feels a bit clearer, abuzz with new energy. {FALSE MEMORIES DETECTED. RESTORE MINDSET?} Y'know what? Why not.;
[status]               You have to admit, it feels good to jill off. Even though whenever you do, you feel yourself losing bits of your psyche, your memories. They all fade when there's a finger in your twat. Thankfully, your implant's there to fill in the gaps, not just about this planet, but various others in the galaxy. You soak up this new information like a horny sponge.;

[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               Welp, another round lost. Guess you have no choice but to jill off. You snicker, before realising you should probably keep an eye out just in case the new round starts while you're still fingering yourself. Shrugging, you ask your implant to go on autopilot for you. And that's all it needs to start doing some real damage to your already addled brain. {DISCREPANCIES DETECTED. ALTERING... 100% FINISHED.

However, your job did come with a nasty addiction... it's lonely out in the black, so you spend your time watching an ungodly amount of porn. Enough to make even the snootiest 'collector' jealous. Enough to actually be name-dropped in some of the shows, though you've never starred in one yourself. Nah, you're fine with just watching and driving. Just like you've always done.;

[status]               Even with the state of the rest of your $BODY$, you were skeptical of joining this game simply because of the chance it would change your hands. Not only do you need them for your job (you work at home in a tech firm, and you're also hoping to get partnered on Twitch), but they've been honed by years and years of gaming to put them in their dexterous and powerful state.;

[tf]               The next change is so subtle that you only notice once you scratch an itch on your $FACE$, and even then, you wonder why the game even did it. Your fingernails are longer, that's it. Though the more you think about it, the more it makes sense. This game's hitting you where it hurts the most: your gaming hands.;
[status]               Your hands are identical to how they were before, but they now have longer nails. It'll suck for gaming, but at least you can just cut them.;

[tf]               You clench your hands into fists, cursing at yourself for losing another round. If only there was a tennis part of the game... when you unclench, your hands are slimmer and daintier, not that you notice any. You crack your new knuckles. Let's do this.;
[status]               Your hands are a bit too callused for your liking, probably still rough from when you took gymnastics in eighth grade. Even so, they look feminine enough, you suppose, though you've never been a nail polish girl.;

[tf]               Hmm... your fingernails are missing something. You reach a hand into your cleavage, pulling out a tiny bottle of nail polish, and begin painting your nails with the glowing purple liquid. It's a bit of a sloppy job, but you're a bit of a sloppy girl.;
[status]               You've got a pair of strong, but callused hands, worn from lifting cargo. Even so, you still have some polish applied to your nails, regardless of if anyone sees them.;

[status]               You're... uh... wearing a thong underneath your khakis, and from the feel of it around your $GROIN$, it's not one of those man thongs people wear at the beach. No, it's too tight for that. You'd look to see what colour and make it is, but... no.;

[tf]               Much like your $SHIRT$ did a few rounds back, the legs of your khakis are sliced off at just above the knee, but this time they don't even hit the ground, disappearing as soon as they're cut off. You shrug. Vanishing pantlegs are the least of your concerns right now.;
[status]               You suppress a shiver as a cool breeze brushes across your now exposed $LEGS$. You don't have any objection to wearing shorts, but this pair was different than the normal fare. It clings to your $LEGS$ and only comes up to your thighs.;

[tf]               You yelp as your shorts close in around your waist, the thong digging in to your $GROIN$. It's thankfully short-lived, and when it's over, at least you've gained a spiffy new pair of gym shorts out of it.;
[status]               You're sporting a short pair of gym shorts that are a bit too short, only just covering your $BUTT$ and showing the straps of your thong. Though you have to admit they're easy to move around in, perfect for those workouts you keep planning.;

[tf]               Aw, kyvt... your shorts just disappeared. This place probably has a Vanishing Clothes Droid, damn VCDs are everywhere nowadays.

[tf]               Oh fuck... the game's already targeting your dick. It must be, since your groin just got really itchy. Taking a deep breath, you slowly put a hand down your $PANTS$ to see the damage... only for it to come back up with a fistful of pubes. Oh. It was just another hair removal. Phew...;
[status]               Your dick has remained unchanged (thank God...), but you've lost your pubes. Hopefully they'll grow back before your next sexual encounter... whenever that may be.;

Your dick. What's happened to your dick?! And why hadn't you paid any attention to it?! It's your dick!! But something truly remarkable happens. As nestle behind the podium to sneak a hand down your $PANTS$, you're suddenly... apathetic to your situation. Yeah, your dick's barely holding onto life. But it's not like you were using it anyhow. Maybe some new junk will be a good change of pace. There's something that feels truly wrong about that thought, but for the life of you, you can't figure it out. ;
[status]               You aren't too keen on thinking about what's happened to your dick, but you can't muster up any anger about it. It's definitely smaller, almost non-existent, even. But it's like any spite's been sapped from you. Surely the work of the game. Or maybe it's always been this way...;

It isn't sexual, so you don't mind baring it for the crowd, as much as they hoot over it. You watch, spellbound, as your dick shrinks into a little nub inside a growing slit, which is currently taking in what remains of your testes. Ovaries, you realise. For your new vagina. Now that it's complete, you pull back up your $PANTS$ with a bit of a scoff. What's so scandalous? It's just your sex.;
[status]               You've got a healthy vagina. At least, you assume it's healthy. You've been putting off your gynecologist cuz of... y'know.

That is, until that damn 'extra net' pipes up. {MLY, YOUR GROIN HAS BECOME UNUSUALLY ACTIVE, EVEN OUTSIDE GAME PARAMETERS. SUGGESTED TREATMENTS ARE...} And then it names a bunch of words that you assume to be medications that you've never heard of before, but by their wording, you're pretty sure you can guess what they do. And it's not helping your pulsing sex. 'Clitterol'. throb. 'Ovulax'. Throb. 'Fuck-Away'. THROB. Once that fucking voice is done naming off fucking meds, you need to change your pants. How could you possibly jill off without using your hands... and from just hearing something as banal as medication?!;

You KNEW making porno that accessible for your implant would fuck you in the ass at one point. Well technically, it's fucking Xyxxyl Spanxx in the ass. Super nice girl. Autographed your tit two years back. Of course, you go on autopilot, jamming your fingers up your cooter as the video of Xyxxyl getting plowed by the three-dicked Stefann is beamed into your eyelids. It's nothing new. Jilling off never is anymore. But the shocked faces of the crowd of humans that greet you when you and Xyxxyl finish confuse you a bit. What's so scandalous? It's just sex.;

But nope, just an average vag with a single clit and a bunch of organs inside that you never bothered to learn. No, the extraordinary thing is your sex drive. It's... a little extreme. You've got a lot of time on your hands with your job, and that time is mostly spent with your hands up your cunt. Though apparently, it 'isn't healthy' to jill off 249 times in a single day. But that was just the ONE TIME. And besides, what the fuck else you gonna do while out in the black? Juggling?;

[status]               Your body's pretty killer right now, with a slight muscle to every edge of your form and a tall stature to match. It almost makes you wish your hobbies involved being outside more often so others could see your bod... almost.;

[tf]               With all the feminine changes inflicting you, you're a bit worried that the game will steal your precious height. Fortunately, it does the opposite, giving you another inch while spreading more muscle around your new curves. Even if the rest of your body was turning all girly, at least your general form is staying nice and manly.;
[status]               If you'd been happy about your figure before, you were thrilled about now. Another inch of height put you above that magical 6' mark. Sure, your narrow waist made your hips look even bigger, but that was a small price to pay. Some people might even like it.;

It's such a gradual thing that you don't notice the changes until they're all finished, but once you do, it's hard to think of a time when you didn't have them.;

It's like you're on a teetering spaceship crashing to Earth, and you have to clench yourself in order to keep down your lunch. This, of course, distracts you from the changes inflicting your body. Inch by inch, your form grows, until it hits an otherworldly seven feet. This height is partnered with mass, as muscle and fat pools on your body. And when you finally look in the mirror, you don't even recognise yourself. {YOU ARE >Mly Bb'tessa<.} Shut up. You are NOT.;
[status]               You have absolutely no idea what the game has in store for you, but judging by your new body, it can't be good. You must be seven feet tall now, towering over everyone in the audience, and the body that you've strived to keep fit for years now has a cushy layer of fat on it.

Looking through the extranet, apparently this place has 'humans', and there are definitely some similarities between your species. Though their height seems to cap at around 1.8 meters, so you've definitely got them beat on that front.

[tf]               You sigh, looking down to avert your gaze from the audience upon yet another loss. It's lucky you did that, as you get front row seats to your next change. Your boots continue to pale in colour until they're pure white, and laces start forming on their fronts, but they don't feel any tighter, even when their very shape contracts against your $FEET$.;
[status]               Your shoes were still boots, technically, but they were rather casual now. The boot only comes to just above your ankle, and the laces look so loose that they're more for visuals than function. Not to mention the whole thing is bright white, not practical.;

[status]               Your chest doesn't feel any weaker than it had before, but it was certainly getting bigger. At this point you couldn't rationalize the extra mass being muscle, they were breasts. Not big ones though, which at least made it somewhat tolerable. ;

Well... if they stay this size, you might be okay. In fact, the more you look in the mirror, the more having breasts just cements itself into your $MIND$. You stop gawking at yourself before you look like a narcissist, though.;

They slowly push out in your hands, despite you pushing back on them, which turns out to be a very bad idea, as it just sends more sparks of pleasure through your $GROIN$. Soon enough, you have a D cup rack, with a hand on each. ;

[status]               Your hair is a bit lighter, almost a dark chocolate hue. What irks you more is how long it is. It's a struggle to keep your hair out of your eyes.;

[tf]               Did anything change? You did lose that last round, thanks in no small part to that damn buzzing. It's only when you put your hand to your forehead in pain that you notice that something DID change: your ponytail has raised up a bit, and yet it tickles your shoulder blades. This much hair is gonna be a bitch in the mornings...;

But it's not a buzz, more like a flitter. And now your head feels about two pounds heavier. What just happened?? You look in the mirror, and your jaw nearly drops to the floor. Your hair... it's now triple the length it once was. And is also purple.;

Why the FUCK is your hair purple?! {The Senerae species sports purple hai-} You clutch your head in your hands to make that damn voice stop, feeling only layers and layers of hair.

[status]               No one would think you were anything but Caucasian, but you looked like someone who spent as much time outside as inside. A quick check down your shirt revealed that the tan was entirely thorough.;

[tf]               Again, your skin tans, and with it comes new memories of your childhood living in... in Crete. Yes, Crete. Not some town in America, though you still have lingering memories of it. Memories that you promptly shove aside in favour of your new life.;
[status]               Your skin is a pleasant tanned brown, showing your Cretian heritage.;

[tf]               You rub an itchy spot on your arm, gawking at the ugly bruise that forms from it. Surely you didn't rub THAT hard? But as it turns out, as you look at the rest of your purplish body, it's not a bruise. It's you.;
[status]               Your skin... well, it has to hail from somewhere, right? There's a lot of people in the world, surely one race has... slightly purple skin?? But what else could it be, but human?;

[tf]               A warmth rolls over your $BODY$, settling on your T&A, before pooling around your $FEET$. Unbeknownst to you, your skin has turned a dark purple, gaining a firmness everywhere but your tits and butt. Of course, to you, you've always had this kind of skin.;
[status]               Your Seneraen skin is a dark purple, with a sponginess on your $BREASTS$ and $BUTT$, but a firmness everywhere else, mimicking muscle.;

[status]               Your ass is big. No 'butts' about it. You've tried to drag yourself to the gym on several occasions, or at least do some squats, but something always gets in the way, usually a campaign. Since this game literally changes people, perhaps it'll shed some pounds off your rump?;

[tf]               When you feel your buttcheeks twitch, you brace yourself for more lost fat. But it doesn't come, instead filling in a with a hint of muscle. You aren't complaining.;
[status]               Your butt looks a bit bigger than it did before, but you're placated in that the growth is more muscle than fat.;

[tf]               The tingles that once befell your $LEGS$ reach your butt, and the same changes afflict it, as your cheeks swell with fat that makes it even more noticeable on you. Hesitantly, you pick up a cheek, dropping it to wield a very unmanly bounce. It doesn't just look fat anymore. It look womanly.;
[status]               Your butt is even bigger than it had been when you started the game. Taking a handful in each hand, you're able to lift it and get a pretty significant drop and then bounce. Sure, you have a bit of muscle to keep it a bit more perky, but it's still just so...jiggly.;

[tf]               Annoyed by your constant failures, you flex your butt to take your mind off the game. With every flex, more muscle forms on your cheeks, though it's applied in a rather feminine way, giving your ass a bit of a bounce. You look at your behind, and ask yourself the age-old question: 'do these shorts make my butt look big?';
[status]               You've always been a bit self-conscious about the size of your butt, even though you keep telling yourself it's muscle, not fat. It still juts out prominently behind you, though it sits high and firm. You can still get that jiggle, but now you could get it just by flexing and unflexing. ;

[tf]               After your $LEGS$ bulked up, you've been wondering when your butt would follow. But you assumed it'd fill with muscle AND fat, not just fat! For that's exactly what happens, the muscle you've worked so hard for fading in place of a more bubblier form. Sure, it still looks sexy, but that's not the point!;
[status]               Your butt just keeps getting bigger and bigger. At least you could probably work off the weight if you end up like this by the game's end, but you have to admit it does emphasise your curves.;

[tf]               You smack your forehead, hearing a painful buzz of static from your implant as you do so, as you feel your butt push out again. This better not be a theme. But despite your protestations, your ass goes from bubble butt to chunky. It... kinda looks hot. Not that you'd ever admit that!;
[status]               Your ass looks like it'd belong on a morbidly obese individual, but since you still have your curves and some of your muscle, it merely shows just how curvy you've gotten. And you're ashamed to say that you're coming around to its look.;

[tf]               MORE?! How could your ass get any bigger?! Any more, and you'll have to sit down for the rest of your life! But your ass doesn't stop growing, your cheeks swelling out until they don't hang off your hips so much as sag there. You brace yourself on the podium, hearing the smack of your cheeks hitting each other. Which gives you an idea... Slowly, you shake your hips back and forth, bursting into laughter at the sound. SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! The host has to step in to get you to stop- and almost goes flying when a cheek smacks into their chest. Heh, that's actually not the first time that's happened.;
[status]               You often find yourself getting jealous of the multiple pornstars you watch and their perfect features. However, you have something that has them all beat: your ass. It's big enough to nearly classify as a 'mutation', two giant cheeks of blubbery fat. You swish when you walk, and it takes five seconds to stop jiggling when slapped. And yes, of course you timed it. Despite all this, you've never really tried anal play when masturbating. But there's a good reason for that: you literally can't reach your hole.;

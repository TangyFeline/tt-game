[LastName]               Bicorn;

[Desc]               <blue>You are Buck Bicorn, co-founder of Borgasm Co., and technology extraordinaire. Well... kinda. You let your partner, Hawthorne work out all the tech crap. You? You're a sex machine making sex machines. Your job is to skim through the sexbot's code and spice it up a bit, cuz as much of a genius as Hawthorne is, you kinda wonder if he has any balls. You make up a perfect team, and it doesn't hurt that he gets all the media attention, leaving you to skim by unnoticed. You shudder to think of the PR nightmare if they found out how many children you've sired...

You're actually here for a bit of PR management. The media hasn't stopped slamming your company for its "perversion", and you're in this gameshow to donate the winnings to charity. Oh, will the public ever be satisfied? Surely they must know that this place turns you into sex maniacs! What did they expect to happen? Still, it'll be an easy gig. After all, what could they possibly change? </blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>With that final erasure, you are complete. Free from that ghastly human that apparently lived in this body, now in a pure and wondrous shape, in body and soul. Though this game show twists your stomach, you nod and politely congratulate your opponent, while smiling knowingly at the flustered and ashamed young woman wearing men's clothing that sits next to the virginal redhead. Making sure that you have tied up any loose ends, your horn sparkles, and you vanish.


The rest of your immortal life is spent in a peaceful and remote forest, occasionally showing up in more populated areas to protect troubled virgin girls from abusive partners in your own special, transformative way. Every so often, no more than twice a decade, a hiker encounters you sleeping, and judging on whether they answer your questions purely and honestly, you gain either a beautiful sister or a beautiful tree. After the centennial of you performing in the gameshow, you think back on what was supposedly your 'old life', and find that you cannot remember a thing about it. You are placated with the fact that whoever you were before would without a doubt be pleased that their body is now home to such a form as you.</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your vocal range is usually on the higher side, but you can lower it to a pantie ripping timbre at a moment's notice.;
[short]               high voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Ever since your $FACE$ changed, you've been nervous of if you'll still be able to speak after this. Sure enough, this round's transformation focuses on your voice, now quieter, softer.;
[status]               You can still speak, thank God, but it's at a much quieter volume. This isn't saying much, though, since your original voice could break the windows of planes with how loud it was.;
[short]               softer voice;
[tgShade]            voice 33;
[WaitFor]           face 3;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your $SHIRT$ brushes up against your$GROIN$, giving you a snippet of infernal pleasure and causing you to let out a pained moan. You immediately notice how softer your voice has gotten, while still retaining its calming qualities.;
[status]               Your voice may be soft, but it is still powerful enough to echo through the building, although that may be the start of its magical tones.;
[short]               demure voice;
[tgShade]            voice 66;
[WaitFor]           face 5;
[WaitFor]           groin 8;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your voice is in no shape for intoning spells. Your horn's magic massages your throat, imparting it with an enlightenment that now sings with power.;
[status]               You do not use your voice very often, believing that actions always trump words, and you never bothered to learn any human tongue, instead imprinting any commands in their minds directly, while hearing their thoughts in your native Houyhnhnm. A naive individual once asked if you could understand neighs, and you understood neither his tongue then nor the tongue of the stallion his mind is now in.;
[short]               ethereal voice;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[WaitFor]           groin 10;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You like to fuck. Okay, when you're around the ladies, you say 'make love', but they'll be the first to say that you're a hell of a lay. Already you're looking through the audience, rating the women you see. 6. 4. Ooh, better take a note on that 8. It's honestly been like this ever since you turned of age. Spenny says you have "sexual dependence", whatever that means, and sure, you really really like sex. It's not like it's ruining your life, and you've moved past your bareback phase, so it's not gonna hurt the chicks either. Whatever. You at least feel happy in knowing that while Hawthorne might have all the brains, he'll never have your stamina.;
[short]               horny and cocky mind;
[tgShade]            mind 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You turn away from another lost round to regain your bearings. Alright. So you're turning into some kinda horse thing. You've seen people turn into cows and pigs before, so this isn't anything new. Even so, it's a result you never could've prepared for, but that's fine. You resolve yourself to never lose another round, as your new horn glows a hypnotic pink. Looks... nice.;
[status]               Even though you're turning into a horse, you're trying to keep your chin up.;
[short]               nervous, but still confident mind;
[tgShade]            mind 12;
[WaitFor]           hair 1;
[WaitFor]           breasts 1;
[WaitFor]           body 1;
[WaitFor]           butt 1;
[WaitFor]           groin 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Now you know something's up. You're turning into a horse, fine, but it's not usually- hell, you can't think of a time when you DIDN'T wanna cum. This game does the opposite, right? You saw Pilgrim last season, that bitch was cumming buckets! So why're you getting cold feet?! Unless, no. No no no no. They wouldn't TAKE AWAY your libido! Who's in charge of this game, Spenny?! Needless to say, it takes a while before you've calmed down for the next round, as your horn does everything it can to dizzy you.;
[status]               You're very nervous about what's going on in your mind right now, how you can't bring yourself to even masturbate. Oh, and the 'turning into a horse' shit. That's important too.;
[short]               jittery mind;
[tgShade]            mind 25;
[WaitFor]           groin 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your last stint with your $GROIN$ has given you time to think. Let's put aside the unicorn thing for the time being. Your libido is being drained from you, and the best case scenario is that it's making way for you to be an even hornier woman, something you're still not wild over, but at least you'd have your drive back. The other thing on your mind is that dumb horn. How it sparkles at the worst times, like whenever you think about sex. Which is all the time. So it's shimmering pretty much once every minute. It used to disorient you, but now it's happened so much that you're kinda used to it, like a hot bath.;
[status]               Your libido may be plummeting, but for some reason, the shining of your horn is taking your mind off it.;
[short]               placid mind;
[tgShade]            mind 37;
[WaitFor]           custom1 3;
[WaitFor]           arms 3;
[WaitFor]           legs 3;
[WaitFor]           shoes 1;
[WaitFor]           pants 2;
[WaitFor]           waist 1;
[WaitFor]           breasts 3;
[WaitFor]           voice 1;
[WaitFor]           hair 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               It's pretty clear now that your horn is shaping your mind. Blinding you whenever you do something wrong, 'rewarding' you whenever you do something right. At first, you tried to challenge it, but now you're seeing stars even without 'disobeying' and just want to collapse. Ok. You win, horn. Before you even finish that thought, your horn envelops your mind in a beautiful, ambrosia massage, feeling better than even the most raucous orgy. It finishes with you on the ground, wheezing from the pleasure. What were you thinking about again?;
[status]               The magic of your horn is reshaping your mind to better fit your body.;
[short]               mellow, submissive mind;
[tgShade]            mind 50;
[WaitFor]           body 3;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               But as you're about to charge at the host to test how sharp your horn really is, it pounds your head with flashing, blinding lights. Wave after wave of light pushes itself into your eyeballs, all with the same message. accept it. Accept it. Accept It. ACCEPT IT. You try to hold on, but it just gets too exhausting, and you collapse on all fours. Weakly getting back on your hindlegs, you know that you're forgetting things, but you don't want to go through that again. Best let your horn tell you what to do. Yes...;
[status]               After that last magical explosion, you are much more compliant of what your horn desires, at the cost of your memories.;
[short]               subdued and accepting mind;
[tgShade]            mind 62;
[WaitFor]           waist 3;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               The most terrifying change now isn't you turning into a girl, or even turning into a unicorn. It's that you're certain that there's another being in your mind, and it's all because of that stupid horn. At that thought, it pulses in your eyes, like a rap on the knuckles from a strict teacher, and you correct yourself, saying 'your own horn'. No! Even now, it's trying to reshape your mind! That 'thing' that's sharing your mind is growing in influence, and you can't let it win! You go over some basic thoughts to yourself to stave off the changes. Your name is still... Bella, you work as an engineer in an android company, and you've been engaged to Curtis for three months. It takes a minute for you to realise that your horn was showering your mind with those soothing shines with every 'fact' you gave, but by that time, you can't remember what your real memories are. Well, you can live with being a girl if it means stopping whatever presence is talking to you in a language you still don't understand, but has a lot of neighing...;
[status]               You are Bella Bicorn... you think. That... your horn is making sure that you forget all of your past in favour of this new persona. You're in a catch 22 from this. You don't wanna think about your past, as you're sure that it isn't real (but didn't you see Curtis just this morning??), but not thinking about it allows your horn to fill in the gaps. You're already not sure how old you are anymore...;
[short]               feminine and chaste mind;
[tgShade]            mind 75;
[WaitFor]           groin 7;
[WaitFor]           hair 4;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               Your horn grows tired of the gradual approach, and flashes a blinding light that lasts a good couple of minutes. In that time, you see bright flashing images, but the three figures you see the most are a disheveled man that looks somewhat familiar, a young girl clutching a unicorn plushie, and a full-fledged unicorn. The unicorn's called Nymphaeaceae, the girl is... Bella, and the man... you can't remember. The more effort you put into remembering his name, the less important he seems, and soon the same applies to the girl, until you can only think of one name: Nymphaeaceae.

You open your eyes to a new world. Everyone is dazed from your horn's blast, struggling to get back in their seats. Even your opponent looks addled. This reminds you of where you are. A game show. You feel like it would be cheating to use your magic in a human made game... maybe you should just focus on changing yourself to better suit your image? After all, there are still some banal human traits in you that need rubbing out.;
[status]               You are Nymphaeaceae... you think. Again, you are not sure of your identity, but the ageless unicorn appears to be the closest fit. You just need to silence the screams of the man named Buckley...;

[WaitFor]           butt 3;
[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               Now, with everything now behind you, you have one more thing to change. You can still feel scattered and distant remnants of the man once known as Buckley Bicorn, screaming at you to remember his past. You smile to yourself as you guide him into the peace of your horns magic, the voice growing quieter and quieter, more and more parts of him agreeing with your current attitudes, that after a while even the rowdiest shouts now demurely accept who you really are. Nymphaeaceae. Budding young unicorn, sent to Earth to protect the honour and purity of the virgins on it. You adjust your $SHIRT$, and silently wait for the 'victor' to be announced.;
[status]               You are Nymphaeaceae, a Unicorn protecting the purity of Earth. Being only fifteen thousand years old, you still have much to learn about the ways of humans, and your sisters always mock you for being too kind to them, but nevertheless you feel a deep connection to the people of Earth. Indeed, it is a myth that Unicorns hate sexuality, far from it. Sex is a part of life, the most beautiful part of it. Your job is simply to keep the virginity of young women (and, in some rare cases, men) until they feel ready to lose it themselves.;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You are living proof that shoe size has nothing to do with what's in your pants. Your feet are laughably small, which makes searching for shoes a bit of a humiliating experience.;
[short]               small feet;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               The same cramp that you still have in your $HANDS$ reaches your feet, and you know now that a clenched fist wasn't the cause of your hands' pain.;
[status]               Like your $HANDS$, your feet are sore and worn.;
[short]               achy feet;
[tgShade]            feet 25;
[WaitFor]           hands 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               The cramp in your feet reaches an excrutiating high, and you nearly trip as your toes bunch together, fusing into two sections. ;
[status]               Your feet have hardened and shortened, with your toes now an increasingly black blob.;
[short]               hooflike feet;
[tgShade]            feet 50;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your toes finally give up the ghost, fusing with the rest of your 'feet', now hard black masses. You clop around experimentally, noting how it sounds all too similar to a horse's gait.;
[status]               You have big black horse hooves where your feet would normally be.;
[short]               hooves;
[tgShade]            feet 75;
[WaitFor]           hair 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Next comes your hind hooves. "This too is Houyhnhnm Cursive. It translates to 'Purity to the Soul'. You will protect all of life, and the virginity of women until they are ready to lose it." More memories are implanted in you, and you smile as the thought of acquiring them in some game show feels more and more like a lie.;
[status]               Your rear hooves, much like your $HANDS$, have Houyhnhnm Cursive engraved upon them. Unfortunately, you were but a foal when you sloppily scratched them in, and so you have to reapply the Cursive every fifty years.;
[short]               hind hooves;
[tgShade]            feet 100;
[WaitFor]           hands 5;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You've got big hands, as known by the multitude of pussies they have petted. As the owners of those pussies can attest, they are softer than they look.;
[short]               big but soft hands;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You make fists in frustration after losing another round, fists so tight that your hands cramp up from it.;
[status]               You have aches and pains in your hands, like what you'd assume Spenny gets with all his keyboard tapping.;
[short]               achy hands;
[tgShade]            hands 20;
[WaitFor]           face 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Not only do your hands cramp up even more, but your fingers are starting to fuse from the involuntary fists you're making. ;
[status]               You can still move your fingers, but it takes way too much effort to do anything but make a fist.;
[short]               fusing hands;
[tgShade]            hands 40;
[WaitFor]           feet 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You try to pry open your hands, but it's no use, as your fingers continue to fuse together. Good thing the game doesn't require much dexterity, at least.;
[status]               Your hands are tough and unwieldy, with only three fingers remaining on each hand.;
[short]               fusing hands;
[tgShade]            hands 60;
[WaitFor]           groin 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               That last masturbation attempt looks to truly be your last, as your fingers finally merge with the blackening keratin that once were your hands. It feel wrong not having opposable thumbs, but that horn is still keeping you from freaking out.;
[status]               Your hands are now useless hooves, with no dexterity at all. An errant thought springs to mind that you could use your horn's magic to pick things up, but no. You're not giving in to that.;
[short]               hooves;
[tgShade]            hands 80;
[WaitFor]           groin 4;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You look at your forehooves, deciding that they would be a good place to cast a ward, and your horn glows bright as you get to work. "This is Houyhnhnm Cursive." you tell yourself as the words spark onto your hooves, as if to educate whoever formerly occupied this body on what is happening. "It translates to 'Nature Bound', and it means that your body and soul will forever be tied to the Earth, to protect all creatures in it." As the runes are cast, memories appear alongside its enchantment, and you realise that even though it allegedly just happened, your $MIND$ refuses to believe that you have not had these words on your hooves for millenia.;
[status]               Your front hooves have Houyhnhnm Cursive  circling around them. Like all written Houyhnhnm, it contains a special enchantment, this enchantment in particular a spell of the Earth.;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have on a fresh pair of dress pants, freshly ironed. This is probably the cleanest pair of pants you've worn in a year.;
[short]               dress pants;
[tgShade]            pants 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Ever since your $LEGS$ changed to the state they're in, the worry that your pants would rip has been in the corner of your mind. When you look down to check on them again, you notice that the game's solved that problem for you, as they're now stretchier and longer, probably twice the size for your original legs, but whatever. You won't look a gift... you won't question it.;
[status]               You have pants that better fit your horrible, horsey legs.;
[short]               looser pants;

[tf]               Like your $SHIRT$ before it, your pants iron themselves out, looking much more presentable. Well, at least you'll be a dapper horse...;
[status]               Your pants have been cleaned and pressed.;
[short]               clean work pants;

[WaitFor]           shirt 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               The growth of your $LEGS$ is too much for your pants to handle, and they snap off, the fabric disintegrating as it falls. The only thing left of them is a pair of shin pads, and you realise with a start that they look just like the guards that you see racing horses wear.;
[status]               You have a pair of shin guards to protect your $LEGS$.;
[short]               shin guards;
[tgShade]            pants 75;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Your magic tickles your $LEGS$ as it turns the scraps of fabric on your shins into proper ice boots. ;
[status]               Your ice boots lack any magical qualities, but they protect your $LEGS$ from the elements.;

[GROIN];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Trapped in your $PANTS$ is your pride and joy. The Bucker. 9 inches of fucking. It's seen twice as many cunts than an OB/GYN, and definitely had ten times the fun doing so. You're kinda surprised he hasn't risen up to join you yet. Not like you have any audience jitters.;
[short]               nine inch monster cock;
[tgShade]            groin 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               These bizarre changes are interrupted by the rising of an old friend, giving off a nice bulge in your $PANTS$. You'd rub one out to relieve the tension, but... fapping's the lazy man's route. You'll settle it after the game.;
[status]               The Bucker's raring to go, but he'll have to wait.;

[tf]               As your dick increases in size, you realise something very important. If you're turning into a horse, that means you'll have a massive cock! Ecstatic, you nearly start jerking it, but then pause. Wouldn't you be jacking off a horse? Kinda? Your $HANDS$ go back to their sides as you ponder this.;

[tf]               Alright!! Not only is your stallion prick lengthening, but it's getting girthier too! You put your $HANDS$ down to give it a test run, but are suddenly hit with a strange revulsion. Not like before, when you were worried about committing self-bestiality, but a feeling that you'd be doing something VERY wrong if you masturbated right now. The glowing of that stupid horn isn't helping things either.;
[status]               You've got a massive cock that might look a bit too equine for the ladies, but it'll satisfy them in length. Perhaps you'll ask if you can keep it after you win.;

But just when you grip your $HANDS$ to your snake... BLAST! Your horn goes nuts, flashing blinding reds after blinding reds until your nearly fall to the ground, hands now gripping your abused head. As soon as you do so, the flashing lights stop, now a soothing, almost apologetic green. You meekly lower a hand, and are greeted with another blast of light. Point taken, you guess.;
[status]               The horn on your head is trying its damndest to stop you from masturbating, or even thinking about your cock.;

[tf]               There's first a burst of pleasure, then a burst of pain as you spontaneously ejaculate. Your horn goes nuts, flashing red sparks after red sparks, until you finally get the message. Yes. You shouldn't come. Ok. The abuse leaves you too scared to even look at your privates, though you can feel that it has shrunk somewhat.;

Even so, this fills you with conflicting emotions, but in the end, the unicorn prevails.;

[status]               Instead of ruminating about your vagina, you think about the charm that encompasses it. It is made of a string from the Fabric of Pudoris, a cloth which strips any and all drives from the creature that wears it.

How the hell are you gonna run a company looking like a fucking HORSE?! As your mind freaks out, a slow, soothing light bathes over it. It's the horn. That damn horn. That was what started all this! But every swear and tirade you throw at it, the horn soaks up like a sponge, only to toss them back as changed thoughts. Yes, you are a unicorn. Yes, everything will be alright with your family. Why would you want to run a company based around meaningless sex? That thought jolts you back to reality, but you can still feel those ideas whirling in your brain, waiting to strike.;

You focus all your magic in the tip of your horn, which pools out to encompass you, giving your fur a glowing sheen.

[tf]               You realise that the reason why your hair is getting longer is because it's turning into a mane. Not that it's an awesome revelation, but it's a small comfort in that it doesn't indicate a gender change like you thought it would.;

You look in the mirror to see the damage, and nearly pass out again. What greets you is a horse's face, with a long snout replacing your nose and mouth, eyes that near protrude on the sides of your muzzle (and of course, once you notice that, you can't help but notice how much wider your vision is), and big ears that are already starting to grow hair. Even your teeth have changed. Barring your oddly human eyes, your face is indistinguishable from a horse.;

The girl is pushing him away, with a expression of both disgust and powerlessness. The man gets more aggressive. "Look, it's just one night. You'll enjoy it, I'll make sure of that." This fills you with an anger that you never thought you had (but somewhere deep down, you always knew that you did) and you stop changing your own body to solve this dispute. The offending man immediately goes limp, his face shrinking, his hair growing, two lumps forming on his chest. "S-s-orry, Katelyn. I need- I need to use the b-bathroom." 'he' blurts out nervously in a voice nothing like the one she used a second ago, as she runs out of the room with her hands near her crotch. You can hear her sobbing and shouting in the washroom a few rooms away, but you won't change her mind fully until she accepts the sins she once committed. Turning to the girl, you start to conjure up new memories of a shy, but cheerful girl named Elizabeth whom she's known since elementary. ;

It is a tricky magic, with your horn playfully winking at you whenever you have forgotten something, or just when it wants to cause unneeded mischief.

[status]               You've got legs, and you know how to use 'em. Well, ok, they're mostly used for jogging, but you once did a crazy chick who demanded you put her in a scissor hold. So there's that.;

[tf]               A sharp and wretched CRACK!!! fills the building, followed by another. There's no pain involved, so you don't know anything's changed until the audience whispers worriedly about your legs, and then you see them. Your legs have twisted backwards, with your ankles raising up and becoming more pronounced as a joint. Their appearance answers your fears: you're becoming a horse.;
[status]               Your legs look like the ones of a shaved and malnourished horse, and even then you've gained some muscle on them.;

[tf]               Just as you were thinking about how weird your $FEET$ look on your legs, they finish their horsey design, bones painlessly twitching and muscle gradually forming around your flanks to present fully your horse legs to the world. ;
[status]               You are a hairless horse from the waist down. You are somehow still able to stand on two legs, but the fear of going down to four isn't unjustified at this point, especially given the shape of your $ARMS$.;

[Desc]               <pink>You are Brenda Hawkins, a 25 year old college student. You've come here both from curiosity, and to set the record straight. Your 'boyfriend' (soon to be ex after you win), Bradley, never stops harping on about how he won this gameshow and went off with a decent cash prize, and to shut him up, you agreed to win it yourself. There are a lot of names that have stuck to you, like 'frumpy', 'buzzkill', and 'frigid', but with this gameshow, you can prove that brains and wit will always triumph over vanity.</pink>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>Like many finales, the losing party walks away nothing like they entered. Where once stood a stuck up human now stands a happy doggirl. After the competition (and a race around the park), Brandy arrived at Bradley's place to break up with him, explaining that he didn't fulfill her 'needs', but they could still be friends. Bradley, having fully expected Brenda to turn into his submissive bimbo, kicked her out in a rage. All this was soon forgotten, as Brandy found a new mate, and has been with him ever since.</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You talk in a loud and firm voice, contralto you once heard one of your hipster friends say. Bradley hates it, constantly bringing it up during your numerous spats. ;
[short]               firm contralto voice;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There's a strange buzzing sensation in your throat. As you try to cough it out, you notice your voice becoming smoother, higher. Once the coughing fit is over, you speak again and realize that your voice is indeed at least an octave higher! While you're freaking out on the inside, you manage to stay calm. They won't silence you. ;
[status]               Your voice has gotten higher and less choppy. Despite trying to stay focused, you find yourself not talking as much.;
[short]               smooth, high voice;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You feel that familiar buzzing in your throat. Desperate not to reveal the changes, tears run down your $FACE$ as you try to stifle a cough... only to turn into a petite sneeze instead. Even without testing it out, you know that your voice has gotten higher.;
[status]               You may not have heard it yet, but you know that your voice raised an octave again. Thinking back to your hipster friend, you assume your voice is a soprano now.;
[short]               cheerful, soprano voice;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Yet again you feel the buzzing in your throat, but you don't mind it now. The last changes to your voice were good, why would this one be different? Sure enough, when you speak, you find your voice has an almost singsongy aspect to it, despite sounding a bit lower. You practise with different vowel sounds, giggling at your new voice.;
[status]               Your voice has changed again to a spirited, more animated tone, despite it being a bit lower. You somehow know that it's not done changing yet.;
[short]               cheerful, soprano voice;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               As you are asking the host a question, a strange 'yip' comes out of your voice. Startled, you try to speak again, only for a loud bark to emerge instead! You giggle at your own voice, which causes you to bark, which causes you to giggle again, which causes you to bark... it takes a couple of minutes for you to settle down.;
[status]               Your spritely voice is sometimes interrupted with barks and yips. You've tried to stop them once, but you have to talk reeeally slowly, and after all, why would you change it? ;
[short]               chipper, barking voice;
[WaitFor]           mind 5;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You are calm and resolute. Nothing will stop you from winning the competition and putting Bradley in his place.;
[short]               determined psyche;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               With all the changes affecting you, you start to panic. Looking at your $HANDS$, your $BREASTS$, your $FACE$... which slowly forms a smile. After all, these aren't horrible changes, right? You can live with these. After a moment's pondering, you shake your head in a panic. Oh God, is there going to be mental changes too?! You feel yourself shaking in your $SHIRT$, but after a while, your complacency starts to return.;
[status]               You have caught yourself starting to accept your changes, which has left you in a bit of a state. ;
[short]               frazzled, slowly accepting mind;
[WaitFor]           hands 1;
[WaitFor]           breasts 1;
[WaitFor]           face 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You catch yourself in a daydream, embracing Bradley with a rough and sloppy kiss. You lower down on your $HANDS$ and $LEGS$ and lick your lips in anticipation as he... WHOA! What was that about? While trying to shake yourself out of your fantasy, you can't help but feel like something's changed, as if a mental block has been taken away. Oh well. It couldn't be that important if you can't remember it.;
[status]               Ever since that arousing fantasy, you feel a bit... freer. Like a weight has been lifted from your mind. It's making you feel better, so it's probably nothing to worry about.;
[short]               friendlier, more positive outlook;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               While waiting for the change, you slip into another daydream, this time more innocent than the last one. You are running in a field with Bradley, the wind blowing through both of your hair. You fly kites, race, play frisbee, and... "BRENDA!" You quickly awake from your daydream, the host and the audience staring at you. You shrug your shoulders and get back to the game, humming a happy tune. Guess you didn't change this time. Too bad.;
[status]               You're pretty certain nothing has changed on the mental front. You're still the same happy-go-lucky girl as ever. Although maybe you've been too accepting of the changes, but so long as they're useful, you can't see the problem.;
[short]               cheerful and content mind;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You take a good look at yourself. Your $BODY$ is one to kill for, your $HAIR$ is immaculate, your $BREASTS$ are perfectly sized. Even your outfit is great, your $SHIRT$ almost straining from your $BREASTS$ and your $PANTS$ showing just enough to tease. And Bradley said this would be hard! This is awesome! He's gonna be sooo jealous when he realises who's dumping his ass! And yet the game isn't over. What else could they do to you? You brush that worry aside. It's been good so far, how bad could it really be?;
[status]               Gone is the stuckup, overly cautious Brenda. She is now replaced with a lax and flirty Brenda, who makes more time for winking at the crowd than playing the game. But it's not over yet, what else could happen?;
[short]               flirty and playful disposition;

[WaitFor]           hands 2;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               As the game is getting boring again, you lose yourself in your daydreams. You bound playfully in the fields, rolling around, climbing trees, playing fetch... wait. Something's not right, but you're too enveloped in your dream to figure it out. Oh yeah! Bradley isn't there! You dream up Bradley chasing you around, but it's not doing it for you somehow. You come to with a whimper, filled with pent up energy as well as a sneaking suspicion that something's changed...;
[status]               You feel... different. Maybe it's all the energy you have, or the growing impulses to smell people, but none of those seem like a problem. But things change in this game, though... right? Whatever it is, you can't seem to put your finger on it, and thinking too hard about one thing gives you a headache anyways.;
[short]               playful, increasingly doglike thoughts;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               You pace around. This game is so BORING! Aren't games supposed to be fun? The host must have heard your whimpering, as he reaches into his pocket and takes out a ba- YOUR ball! You snatch it from him with your $FACE$ greedily and roll on the floor with your favourite toy. This of course means that it takes even longer for the host to steer you towards the 'real' game, but your attention span is too low to bother playing it anyway. You'll humor them for now until they let you go for a walk and maybe a mate.;
[status]               You are Brandy, an exciteable, if a bit dim, doggirl. People always complain that you never pay attention to things, but why focus on one thing when there are so many things happening around you!;
[short]               happy, doggy mind;
[WaitFor]           face 5;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your feet are hidden in your $SHOES$, a bit small, but manageable. The nails are unpolished and uncoloured. ;
[short]               small feet with plain toenails;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You get a strange feeling in your feet. You bend down to look at them, but then you'd have to take off your $SHOES$... it's probably not important.;
[status]               You're sure that your feet have changed in some way, but you don't have energy to take off your $SHOES$ to see.;
[short]               supposedly small feet with plain toenails;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your feet ache again, and this time it's painful enough that you take off your $SHOES$ to see them. It seems that they've changed quite a bit while being in your $SHOES$, they are tiny and cute, with garish pink nail polish. You quickly put your $SHOES$ back on, hoping nobody saw your toes.;
[status]               Your feet are small and feminine, with pink nail polish on your toes. They are hidden in your $SHOES$ so as to not draw attention to them.;
[short]               little feet with toes capped with pink nail polish.;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your feet suddenly cramp up. Screaming in pain, you remove your $SHOES$ to see your toes fusing together, with your pinky even vanishing. What more, a sprinkle of hair is growing around them. You sigh in relief, however, as you see that your nail polish is untouched;
[status]               Your feet are a weird cross between feet and paws. They're really uncomfortable to stand on.;
[short]               fused feet with four toes and slight claws;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Your feet finally shift into proper paws. You stare contently at your painted claws, knowing that your routine in the mornings is all worth it.;
[status]               At your hind legs, you have nicely maintained, golden blonde paws with pink nail polish on your claws. Sure, the polish rubs off after a good run, but they're too pretty not to have!;
[short]               dog paws;
[WaitFor]           legs 4;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your hands are slightly calloused, with a slight scar on your right hand from a nasty burn. The fingernails are short and surprisingly pristine, if only because you've never gotten past the habit of biting them.;
[short]               rough hands with short fingernails;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There's a weird, soothing sensation coming over your hands. When you look at them, you see how smooth they are. That scar on your right hand has vanished, and even your nails are longer. You are not swayed, at some point they'll turn into lobster claws or something.;
[status]               Your hands are no longer bumpy and coarse, instead being smooth and silken. ;
[short]               smooth hands with clean fingernails;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your hands ache again, but this time you catch them changing, your fingers growing out. You falter for a bit, before noticing the pretty pink nail polish on your nails.;
[status]               Your hands are a far cry from the callused messes you came with. Now they are long and smooth, with shiny pink nails.;
[short]               smooth hands with long fingers and pink fingernails;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You feel great pain in your hands, as if an invisible force was crumpling them up. You watch through the pain as your fingers start fusing and your thumb starts to shrink. At least your nail polish is still on.;
[status]               Your hands have seen better days. Your fingers have fused together, and your palms have a strange leathery surface. Stranger still, you don't seem to be too concerned about this.;
[short]               pawlike hands with pink nail polish;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You gaze up at your hands in wonder as they finish forming into dog paws. You are first saddened by the disappearance of your thumbs, but that thought is quickly taken over by your pink nail polish on your claws.;
[status]               Your front legs have doggie paws with pink nail polish on the claws. Sometimes you lament that you don't have opposable thumbs, but you make do with your mouth just fine. ;

[WaitFor]           body 6;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have on some grey sweatpants with a ketchup stain on it. Not that you're a slob, you've purposefully chosen the dirtiest outfit you have to prove that it's not the outside that counts.;
[short]               dirty, stained sweatpants;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your pants gradually shrink until they're halfway up your $LEGS$, after which they gain a dull pink colour. You try to pull them down to your $FEET$ but to no avail. At least that ketchup stain is gone, you were getting sick of the smell.;
[status]               Your sweatpants have shrunken to the thighs of your $LEGS$, and are now a dull pink. As odd as it sounds, you feel uncomfortable showing this much skin to an audience.;
[short]               dull pink sweatpants with legs down to your shin;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You feel your pants shrink again, now forming a pair of shorts that barely go to the knee. You silently fume. Now not only are you wearing stupid shorts, but you'll be cold while doing so!;
[status]               Your pants have changed again, now pink shorts that give your $BUTT$ a nice shape.;
[short]               pair of pink shorts;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your shorts start to feel looser, but just as you're hoping they'll change back, the leg holes fuse, becoming a miniskirt. You're torn with this. Even though it's much more feminine, you'd be lying if you said you didn't wear it well...;
[status]               Your pants have made quite the journey, from sweatpants to shorts, and now a miniskirt. You sometimes twirl around to feel it swaying. ;
[short]               short pink miniskirt;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Another piece of clothing disappears, leaving only your panties. As you're about to complain to the host, the pair starts to shrink, forming frills on the edges, while turning a light pink. You sigh in relief. At least now you've got something pretty to wear.;
[status]               You are wearing a sweet looking pair of pink panties. Somehow you're not concerned about your privacy with thousands of people watching you.;
[short]               cute pink panties;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Itchy, itchy, itchy! You tear your panties to ribbons, leaving a mess of pink fabric on the ground. Phew. That's better. You ignore the stares and whispers as you suddenly start to smell your $GROIN$ much more directly...;
[status]               Your pretty panties are now just a bundle of pink strings. A shame, but they were really getting in the way, in more ways than one...;

[GROIN];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your groin... you'd rather not think too much about it. You haven't had sex in months, not since you tried 'angry sex' with Bradley. It didn't really work out.;
[short]               vagina;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You feel a small tingle in your $PANTS$. Oh no. Oh no no no no. You've heard about this part from Bradley. His opponent turned into a butch bodybuilder with an IQ of 2. But before you get any further worrying, you realize that nothing else seems to have changed down there. Huh. Guess that's it.;
[status]               Even though you were sure something changed, your vagina is the same as ever. It seems a little cleaner, but that's it.;
[short]               vagina;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Ok, now you're feeling something. But instead of something bursting out of your $PANTS$, your vagina feels... looser? Maybe that's not the right word, but... it feels a bit more relaxed. You shrug your shoulders and keep playing, but for some reason, an image of Bradley goes through your mind...;
[status]               Even though your vagina has changed for the second time, you don't feel any different. Oh well.;
[short]               vagina;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Without thinking, you put your $HANDS$ to your crotch. There's a splash of heat that pools into your vagina and abdomen. You feel so tempted to take off your $PANTS$ and go to town, but you reel yourself back. For the time being.;
[status]               Your vagina is hot and bothered. You're considering calling for a bathroom break to settle things out.;
[short]               stimulated vagina;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Just when you were getting used to the heat, your vagina flares up again. You make a strange noise between a groan and a whimper as you struggle to keep your $HANDS$ off. ;
[status]               You are struggling to keep still, as the heat between your $LEGS$ is growing stronger. As much as you know how many people would watch you do it, you can't help but go over the idea of... direct satisfaction.;
[short]               enflamed vagina;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Heat... so much heat... You paw at your vagina, but it still won't cease. Suddenly, an odd idea goes through your $MIND$. You kneel down, and bring your $FACE$ close enough to lick your vagina. The feeling is incredible, and you come within minutes, howling as you climax all over your $FACE$. As you get back up, the crowd is speechless. "What?", you ask innocently, licking a stray drop of juice from your face. ;
[status]               You now know the meaning of the phrase "like a bitch in heat". Your vagina is pulsing, and even though your licking soothed it somewhat, you know that only a mate can truly douse the flames...;

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You look a rougher side of thirty, contrasting with your actual age of 25. You don't mind though, age is experience after all. People (Bradley especially) offer advice on how to clean up pores, push your chest out, make yourself look 'presentable'. You don't care, who do you need to impress? Your favourite feature is your height, six foot even, towering over your friends and intimidating men. Your skin is near snow white from your lack of sunlight.;
[short]               tired looking, 25 year old six foot body with pale skin;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your body is wracked with pain. Nobody told you about this part of the competition! After what feels like hours but was probably minutes, the pain subsides and you can look at the damage, gasping at what you see. Your hips have grown, your waist is narrower, your shoulders are pushed back to show off your $BREASTS$, and worst of all, you have gotten shorter! Looking at others for a sense of measurement, you estimate that you're now 5'7, three inches shorter! What more, you almost feel... younger. The number '23' suddenly pops into your head, but no. You can't be younger. You just can't. You promptly brush these thoughts aside and get back to the game.;
[status]               Your body has regressed a bit, with three inches taken from your height. Aside from that, your figure has greatly increased, as your waist has narrowed while your hips have widened. You try not to look in the mirror.;
[short]               shivering, 23 year old 5'7 body with pale skin;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               This time the changes focus on your skin, tanning it while smoothing out any wrinkles or acne. You rub your skin, marvelling at its smoothness, and almost write this change off as a good thing until you notice two more inches gone from your height. Annoyed, you switch your focus back to the game.;
[status]               Your skin is now slightly tanned, as if you spent an hour in the sun each day. You have also grown shorter, now 5'5.;
[short]               attractive, 23 year old, 5'5 body with slightly tanned skin.;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You feel more pain, but not as bad as the last time. Again your body regresses, with your hips that once grew shrinking down again. At least you didn't shrink. The number '22' forms in your $MIND$. Whatever.;
[status]               You now have the body of a twentytwo year old, with flared hips and tanned skin. You've started to just accept these changes now.;
[short]               attractive, 22 year old, 5'5 body with tanned skin;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Again you feel pain, but not as bad as usual. When you look in the mirror, you jump back in shock. Your legs have shrunk to about the size of your arms, making you about 5'1. Your waist has widened a bit, whereas your hips have widened even more. There's a weird crick in your back which forces you to walk in an almost hunched position. Then, while you're gazing at the mirror, you feel itchiness overcome your whole body. You lie on the floor and cry. They're making you ugly!;
[status]               You have a weirdly proportioned body, with your arms and $LEGS$ seeming to be the exact same length, as well as your hips being a bit too big on your body. What more, you're itchy everywhere...;
[short]               strangely shaped,  22 year old, 5'1 body with itchy skin;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               For the first time, your body changes painlessly. It almost tickles as your hips bend in weird shapes to accommodate walking on fours. Patches of fur start spreading along your skin, but they sadly stop before you are completely covered, leaving you looking like a mess. All of this happens while you're still shrinking, becoming a puny 5'1. You hear the number '19' in your head. Well, duh. You know how old you are.;
[status]               You have a strange mixture of dog and human characteristics. Your hips seem canine enough, but your fur is patchy and messy. All of this makes you feel inferior, and you wish that your coat would grow in soon.;

[tf]               You stare in awe as your boots transmogrify into some plain pink sneakers. All things considered, they look alright, but you're still scared of what else is to come.;

[tf]               You feel yourself grow a bit taller, although upon inspecting yourself you realize that isn't the case. Your sneakers just gained a slight heel, looking pinker and shinier. Much like their previous change, they don't look all that bad, but you can't walk in heels to save your life!;

[tf]               You adjust your $SHIRT$. Something feels really uncomfortable in there, and it is only with close examination that you find the culprit. Your breasts have grown! In spite of knowing how bad this game and its changes are, you can't help but jump for joy. Finally you'll be respected as an adult.;
[status]               Your diminutive breasts have grown, now sitting smugly in your $SHIRT$ They're still an A cup, just on the larger side of it. Of all the changes that could happen, this one is the best. You just hope they don't keep growing, although you know that they will.;

[tf]               Just as you suspected, your breasts grow again, forming a respectable B cup. This is exactly what you feared when you entered this competition. No matter, you'll just cross your arms to hide any cleavage. You still have control over the situation.;

The more you see them fill out your $SHIRT$, the more you seem to like them. Your $MIND$ made up, you put your $HANDS$ to your sides, glancing around to see if anyone's noticed your new rack.;
[status]               Your breasts have grown again, this time becoming perkier and rounder. Even your nipples are bigger, making two tiny dents in your $SHIRT$. You could get used to these.;

[status]               Your breasts are huge, now bordering a D cup. You can't keep your $HANDS$ off them, rubbing them around your sensitive nipples. You also have itchiness below them that won't seem to go away...;

[tf]               They just keep growing! You bounce up and down as your breasts turn into double Ds. Once you stop bouncing, you see that the itchy spots on your stomach have formed weird lumps. You touch one and instantly feel a jolt of pleasure through your $GROIN$. After a few seconds to catch your breath, you put your $HANDS$ on the bumps again. Whatever they are, they're fun to play with!;

As they gradually grow into an A cup, you heft your DDs towards your $FACE$ to try and lick them. No such luck. You'll have to get someone else to do it...;

[status]               Your black hair is neatly done up in a bun. You started doing this when you tended the fries at Burger Palace, and the style stuck. Sure, it might take a little more time prettying up, and Bradley prefers it down, but you like how it doesn't get in your $FACE$.;

[tf]               You feel your neatly placed bun slowly unravel. Damn it, it's too much trouble to put it back up right now, but you hate how long your hair is. Looking at a strand, the jet black colour appears to have faded into chestnut. ;
[status]               Your hair has mysteriously escaped its bun, and is now loosely and messily getting in your $FACE$. Once there is a lull in the game, you have to straighten it up a bit. Your hair has also turned a chestnut brown, and is it longer?;

[tf]               Suddenly you feel your hair part away from your $FACE$. Relieved at first, you do double take as you see your hair now goes down to your shoulders, and is more a dirty blonde than brown. How are you going to take care of it now??;

[status]               Your face is average and nearly makeupless. Ever since you were a kid, you never bothered with your appearance that much. Still, your face is competently framed, and you appreciate your sparkling green eyes. Perhaps your nose could be a bit smaller, now that you think about it, but... nah, it's fine.;

[tf]               There's a strange pressure in your face, specifically around your nose. Pulling up a strange handheld mirror you watch in awe as your face shifts into a nicer form, with a smaller nose and larger lips. You grimace in the mirror.;

Your face has been decorated with makeup, including a darker blush, brighter lipstick, and provoking eyeshadow. You take several pictures of your new look, making a cute pout when the host says it's time for the next round.;

You now have an elongated face, and your nose has gotten bigger, but more sunken in. Your ears also have gotten longer, as you realise when you scratch an annoying itch. You stare at the mirror in curiosity until the host informs you that the next round is starting, not even discovering your once green eyes are now brown.;

Unfortunately the first smell you come across is from your $GROIN$... after a few minutes of sniffing wildly, you finally compose yourself, licking your dry nose.  ;

It must be static electricity from your piercing or whatever.;

It is only later that you realize that your t-shirt has gained a little colour.;

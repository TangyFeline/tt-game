[Desc]               <blue>What are you fighting this time?! Glaring at you is a character from a fantasy novel, or at least that's what he seems to want to be seen as. A floppy wizard hat tops his acne-ridden head, and a cloak that looks suspiciously like a bedsheet is draped around his body. Finishing off the look is a baluster, with some red wrapping paper on top to complete the effect. He must have seen you giggling, as he bursts into a nasally tirade. "Fool!! You dare chortle at my technique? I am wearing a blessed fireproof +5 cloak of celibacy, with my trusty Staff of Aesculapius. This gives me four extra stages to be hit before my mind enters its waitfor phase!!" Stages? Cloaks? Waitfor phases? You have no idea what he's talking about, but no matter. You're sure he won't remember anything once you're done with him, you muse as he noisily breathes from an inhaler.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>...This didn't go as planned. Where you expected to stand a bubbly bimbo, instead a seven foot cow...thing towers over you, and she doesn't look happy. You close your eyes, trying to flash your life through them before it's all over, when you hear only a THUMP! Nervously opening your eyes, you see Muu'laqh crouched down on one knee, as she utters with difficulty, "Good, Game."

Reaching home with your winnings, you immediately hear about a bounty hunter in the city, willing to solve any dispute for a price. In spite of this, you don't see Muu'laqh again until months later, when you spot her in a bar with about ten empty beer mugs, her double axe at her side, and most surprisingly, a top able to contain her breasts. As soon as she sees you, she jumps up and gives you a crushing hug, sitting you down to tell others about "that dumb game", and announcing you as "the only human to beat Muu'laqh!" She seems to have done well for herself, learning English to a degree and getting wealthy off her earnings. The night goes by smoothly until she drunkenly challenges you to a 'friendly' drinking contest, and you don't really remember anything else after that...</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Dexter has the weasilly voice of Jerry Lewis, with none of the charm.;
[short]               nasally and wimpy voice;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There's a look of shock on Dexter's face, before it goes right back to smug. "Oho! You think that you have bested the... whoa..." You join him in his surprise, as his voice has suddenly plummeted an octave or two while speaking. "You think you have beaten the Great Feiselberg the Unfazed?" Somehow, this outburst sounds more serious when uttered in his current voice.;
[status]               Dexter's voice has taken a couple hits of testosterone, even if that nasal whine is still present.;
[short]               deeper voice;
[WaitFor]           mind 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Dexter exhales in disappointment at another round lost, and you both hear how deep that exhale was. He tests out a couple of 'spells', and that nasal drone has vanished from his voice (you don't like how his $CUSTOM1$ twinkled at each spell, though...);
[status]               Dexter's voice is deep and guttural, with no sign of his previous nasally lisp.;
[short]               deep voice;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               "Oh yeah??" Dexter mouths off at you. "I let you win that one! You're not gonna get the rest of the wins so easily!! Just fuckin' try it, wimp!!!" The angrier he becomes, the lower and huskier his voice gets, until it's a thunderous groan that's left you with a nasty earache.;
[status]               Dexter belts his words out in a loud and drawn out grunt. ;
[short]               husky and raw voice;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Dexter is about to curse you out for winning another game, but his brow furrows as he struggles to get out the words. "Yooo... Need stooop... Nooo win..." It looks to be too difficult for him, so he simply snorts quite violently in your direction.;
[status]               Dexter is starting to lose his vocabulary, and the words that he can get out have long "Ooohs", with a faintest suggestion of a feminine tilt to them. You don't think it's because he's too stupid for speech, but more that English is getting increasingly harder for him to use.;
[short]               grunting voice with broken English;
[tgShade]            voice 33;
[WaitFor]           mind 5;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               "OOMOSNEE!!" Dexter shouts out, his hand slamming against the wall behind him hard enough to leave a dent. Sensing the confusion of the audience around him, he tries to correct himself. "Uhhh... Booo... Boooadd loos.";
[status]               Dexter's voice is low and lowing, and it's very clear that English isn't his first language. As to what is his original language... you can't say, but it definitely involves a lot of snorting and mooing.;
[short]               lowing voice;
[tgShade]            voice 33;
[WaitFor]           mind 6;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You already know that you would've picked on Dexter in middle school. Everyone would have. It isn't because he's nerdy, or clearly likes to LARP, or even because he's wearing a $SHIRT$ (though all of those help). It's because he has that snide, holier than thou attitude that can only work on someone... not of his stature. That said, he's less annoying and more comical, especially with how he takes constant inhaler breaks. ;
[short]               dweeby, nerdy mind;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               "ha HA!!!" Dexter bursts out, startling you a little. "You fell into my trap card! Just like I planned, the game has turned me into a real wizard!! I roll 12 on initiative! The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!!" He's having WAY too much fun with this.;
[status]               Now that Dexter's clothes have upgraded to the real thing, he's gotten far more hammy and energetic.;
[short]               excited mind;
[WaitFor]           shoes 1;
[WaitFor]           pants 1;
[WaitFor]           shirt 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You're a bit ticked with Dexter's changes so far. Here you thought that the game would turn him into a stupid, horny bimbo, when it's actually done the complete opposite! It's pretty clear that Dexter is concerned with the changes his body is going through as well, until his eyes light up like a lightbulb had spawned over his head. "Of course! The game turned me into an ordinary wizard, and now is bulking my muscles to change my class into spellsword! I just need to lose more rounds so I can cash in my attributes, and then I'll crush you with both might AND magic!" ...Sure, buddy. Whatever it takes for you to lose the game.;
[status]               Dexter has thrown caution to the wind, and has gotten it in his mind that further losses will increase his musculature. For all you know, he's right.;
[short]               cocky mind;
[WaitFor]           body 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               "Ha HA! See, everyone? I keep losing rounds, and keep gaining muscle! This game's a fuckin' cinch!!" Dexter immediately covers his mouth in shock at dropping an F bomb, but he quickly recovers. "Yeah, doesn't matter if I swear, anyway. What're they gonna do to me?! Fuck fuck fuck!" Whatever's happening in Dexter's mind, it's certainly making him more of the meathead he looks.;
[status]               Dexter is slowly losing focus of everything other than 'winning' the game.;
[short]               overconfident and brash mind;
[WaitFor]           body 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Dexter grows quiet as the host announces you the victor yet again, before exploding. "FUCK IT!! I was losin' these rounds on purpose, but I dun' need that to kick yer' ass! You wanna' settle this like MEN, then get off that STUPID pedestal thing and we take this outside!!" A couple of security somehow bigger than he is pull him back, but not with one of them getting a quarterstaff to the jaw. Maybe you should think twice before winning any more rounds...;
[status]               Dexter's gained a very, very short fuse,and it seems as though his intellect is draining from his ears.;
[short]               violent, dumber mind;
[WaitFor]           body 3;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You just now notice that Dexter's eyes are a dull and dumb brown, and he unfortunately takes this eye contact as a challenge. "Makin' fun o' me? Issat it? How 'bout you laugh widdan axe down your throat?! Lessee then when you- HEY!!!" Dexter screams out at a screen that tells of him losing over forty rounds. "HE?! HE?!! You DARE think'a me as some puny lil' MAN?! How'dya think I was winnin' all these rounds if I had no tits?!" You think twice before informing him of his $GROIN$, as small as it is, and instead focus on how all the screens are hastily changed to give Dexter feminine pronouns.;
[status]               Not only does Dexter act more brutish with each passing minute, but it appears that he identifies himself as female.;
[short]               brutish, female mind;
[tgShade]            mind 33;
[WaitFor]           breasts 4;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               You know that the goal of the game is to win, but... you're frightened of what Dexter will do next, and you already see flames in his eyes. You are saved by the host intervening, who calms him down in a language you've never heard before. Whatever they said, Dexter's mood changes, and he even bows to you so low that his $FACE$ almost touches the floor. "Sohhrry. Not of honour to take doooo... doofeat so mad. Yooou win round." He leaves you with a rather bovine snort from his nose.;
[status]               Dexter has thankfully regained some composure, even though he still looks livid whenever he loses. You also have the fleeting suspicion that some... cowlike traits have arisen within him.;
[short]               fiery and animalistic, yet honourable mind;
[tgShade]            mind 66;
[WaitFor]           groin 3;
[WaitFor]           voice 4;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               Dexter merely snorts as he loses another round, before spitting out a green blob on the floor like he just hocked some chewing tobacco. Cud, you assume. He wrings his $CUSTOM1$ in his $HANDS$, looking aloof and bored to be in this silly game. You see that his name on the LED screens in front of you has been changed to Muu'laqh "The Heft". ...okay...;
[status]               You are up against Muu'laqh "The Heft", a name that just slips off the tongue. He, by his own insistence, is a barbarian Holstaurus from the plains of Mamferox, and though it seems as silly as his appearance the beginning of the match, you have no trouble believing it now. His eyes dumbly, but alertly scan the audience for any threats, and he sometimes snorts violently. Despite his rather scary demeanour and $BODY$, there's no reason for you to think he's aggressive... you hope.;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Dexter has big feet, or "hobbit feet" as he would call them.;
[short]               large feet;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You were wondering if Dexter's feet would change, and your query is answered with them growing bigger inside his $SHOES$.;
[status]               Dexter had big feet before, but now they're massive. Not quite clown shoe level big, but close enough.;
[short]               large feet;
[WaitFor]           shoes 3;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Dexter drags his feet across the ground, like a bull that's about to charge. His feet start to blacken with what you at first think is dirt, but on second glance looks too shiny.;
[status]               The more you look at Dexter's feet, the weirder they look. They are strangely black and shiny, and some of his toes have started to fuse together. Hooves, perhaps?;
[short]               blackened feet;
[WaitFor]           mind 6;
[WaitFor]           shoes 4;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Dexter stomps his foot down and snorts angrily. This causes everybody to look down at his feet, which somehow managed to turn into cloven hooves immediately after his loss. He starts tapping the now cracked ground with one ominously. Better finish this quick.;
[status]               Dexter has a pair of hooves for feet, with only two toes. It seems suitable enough, considering the rest of his $BODY$.;
[short]               hooves;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Dexter has some spindly and gnarled fingers on his otherwise normal hands. His short fingernails indicate a lifetime of nailbiting.;
[short]               spindly hands;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You wouldn't have expected to see muscle growth on hands, but after the results of Dexter's $ARMS$ comes the same treatment to his palms and fingers. Although it might be that they're just bigger. ;
[status]               Dexter has a good pair of manly hands that still contain nibbled off fingernails.;
[short]               large hands;
[WaitFor]           arms 2;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Dexter cracks his knuckles loudly, chuckling as they snap like a whip. His glee doesn't lessen when he feels them grow even more in size. His fingernails also heal themselves.;
[status]               Dexter's hands are fat and menacing, although their clean fingernails somewhat ruins their effect.;
[short]               thick hands;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               "Fuck." Dexter swears, his mind too focused on his loss to see his hands swell up yet again. He makes tight fists, then loosens them to softly sprinkle shavings of his fingernails on the ground.;
[status]               Dexter has huge meaty hands,and jagged fingernails to match.;
[short]               meaty hands with jagged nails;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Dexter makes angry fists and looks ready to punch the poor host that approaches him. They grow to monstrous mitts as he does this, and when he unclenches them, they have grown shiny black nails. ;
[status]               One of Dexter's hands could easily envelop your whole face. They're as beefy and strong looking as the rest of his $BODY$, with shiny black nails that you could only guess are keratin.;
[short]               huge hands with black nails;
[WaitFor]           feet 2;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Though hidden by his $SHIRT$, you can see that Dexter's cargo pants have plenty of pockets. Looking closer, you can see the imprints of a calculator in one, an inhaler in the other, maybe a pair of dice, but then you quickly turn your head away, as Dexter was getting the wrong idea on where you were looking.;
[short]               cargo pants;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               One by one, the many pockets on Dexter's pants disappear. He freaks out for a bit, before wheezing a sigh of relief when he finds his inhaler unscathed.;
[status]               Not much has changed about his pants, except for most of the bulky pockets are gone.;
[short]               beige pants;
[WaitFor]           custom1 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Dexter's $LEGS$ become visible as his pant legs are sliced off, gaining a few pockets in the process.;
[status]               Dexter has on a pair of cargo shorts that look like a smaller version of the pants he came in with.;
[short]               cargo shorts;
[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               The pant legs of Dexter's shorts continue their ascent to his $GROIN$, before promptly tearing off and covering his penis. Is it sad that the first thing you notice is how his dick is the exact size you thought it would be?;
[status]               Dexter has a simple red loincloth on that only covers his $GROIN$ and $BUTT$, and not the rest of his lower body.;
[short]               loincloth;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Rips and tears begin to show on Dexter's already mangy loincloth. Fortunately for his modesty (or unfortunately for your vision), it's left in a somewhat wearable form.;
[status]               Dexter's $GROIN$ is covered up with a loincloth that isn't much more than a rope with a square of fabric. You realise that no such square is hiding his $BUTT$, and wonder wickedly how the view is for the audience in the back.;
[short]               torn loincloth;

[GROIN];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You ever hear that internet meme that says if you reach a certain age as a virgin, you become a wizard? Yeah... enough said.;
[short]               inexperienced penis;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               With the new $PANTS$, you can clearly see Dexter's already tiny dick shrink further, now maybe only about three inches. "The fuck?" Dexter curses out, looking down. "This show's 'sposed to make ALL of my things big!;
[status]               Dexter has an even smaller penis than the one he came in with.;
[short]               very small dick;

[WaitFor]           pants 3;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Not knowing what changed on Dexter this round, it takes you searching his loincloth to find the answer. His penis is now an embarrassing micropenis, with only the head peeking out. For some reason, he doesn't kick up as much of a fuss as when it first started shrinking...;
[status]               Dexter's penis is about an inch, and even that's being generous.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You gape in disbelief as Dexter remains unaware of his penis shrinking to about a few centimetres, before the skin below it opens up to complete his new vagina. You'd tell him, but you're kinda scared of what he'll do to you...;
[status]               Dexter is officially a woman, his $PANTS$ doing a shoddy job at hiding his lady parts.;

[tgShade]            groin 75;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Dexter takes the hilt of his $CUSTOM1$ and slowly, deliberately inserts it into his vagina, at first shocking you at his lewdness, then shocking you at how much is fitting in there. Once about halfway inserted, he begins to roughly thrust the makeshift dildo, his moans sounding a lot like moos. He doesn't bring himself to climax, instead removing his axe after a few minutes, wiping the handle on his $PANTS$.;
[status]               Though you're scared to look closely, you know that Dexter's vagina is quite deep. His $PANTS$ don't do a stellar job in concealing that fact.;

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Dexter looks every bit the way you'd think he would, with a 5'4 body that still manages to look gangly and skinny. No muscles are visible on his body, and you wonder if he has any at all. His skin is a horrid pasty white, like gone off milk.;
[short]               puny and weak 5'4 body;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Even though the changes to Dexter have merely bulked him up to that of an average man, the change to his body itself prove that something else is going on. He grows a few inches and gains more muscle on the layer that he's already attained. ;
[status]               Dexter looks like a guy who works out every day, and regardless of whether or not that's actually true, his physique offers a strong argument for it.;

[tf]               Dexter shoots up to six feet as more and more muscle in piled onto his frame. "Heh heh heh... who's the wimpy geek now?!" He asks noone in particular.;
[status]               Dexter's body looks nothing like it did before. Now at six feet, his limbs and front are teeming with a healthy amount of muscle.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Dexter grows another five inches as he's busy flexing his $ARMS$ to members of the audience. They gain more muscle as well, alongside the rest of his figure.;
[status]               Dexter looks like those musclehead jocks you see at the gym, and he's slowly matching their attitude.;

[tf]               Dexter is busy pawing at his $BREASTS$ to comment on either the lost round or his next change, with his body growing again to a 6'5, and his skin tanning to a dark bronze. You notice that more muscle is packed on his back muscles, which you assume will help with the melons on his front.;
[status]               Dexter has become a goliath of a man at 6'5. His skin has a bronzed tan, and while every section of him is full of muscle, a considerable amount is located in his back, most likely to help with his $BREASTS$.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Dexter looks about to charge at you with his $CUSTOM1$ until thankfully he is distracted with the changes in his body. It grows to what's probably seven feet, as it inexplicably manages to grow more muscle, though in a way that makes him look not like a roided out bodybuilder, but instead a solid hunk of mass. Almost like he didn't even need to work for his figure. It's just how his species looks.;
[status]               Dexter's body doesn't look human, plain and simple. It's too tall, too ripped, too SCARY to be of this world. The closest thing it reminds you of is if a bull stood on two legs. A bull with massive round breasts that is.;

[tf]               Dexter steadies himself with his $CUSTOM1$ as his shoes morph below him. The loose laces merge into the toes, creating a pointy tip, and turning an forest green. "Hmmm..." Dexter ponders, looking down at his $FEET$. "The blessed +2 corrodeproof Whisperfeet. Not bad." He eyes slyly at you, but the effect is broken with a puff of his inhaler.;
[status]               Dexter has green slipper-like shoes with pointy toes. They lack any laces or straps, and you've never seen the likes of them before, aside from elvish footwear on tv. He calls them "Whisperfeet".;

You don't know why you're so enamoured with Dexter's breasts (especially since it's pretty clear by now that he's not going to be a tittering bimbo), but they were worth the weight... err, wait. His pecs swell up into two perfect, C cup globes, their nipples peeking out of his $SHIRT$ as Dexter tries to conceal them with a sudden display of modesty.;

Dexter finally notices at what could be an I cup. He looks at them in curiosity, before smacking them again. His breasts don't change, and he clenches his fist in frustration.;
[status]               Dexter has some of the biggest breasts you've ever seen, even for Transformania Time standards. Even now, he looks down at them hopefully, wishing them to be even bigger. You don't think that could be possible.;

Dexter lifts up a teat triumphantly, carrying it as if it were some silver platter, before dropping it down with a jiggling thump. The abused tit continues wobbling for minutes,it seems. Or maybe it's because you're so hypnotised by their size. It's almost laughable.;
[status]               It's a wonder that Dexter can even stand with the breasts he's sporting. Breasts don't even sound like the right word... more like fleshy, oval exercise balls. In spite of their size, they look as tough as the rest of the muscle on his $BODY$. Quite obviously, he's not wearing a bra. What cup size would they even fit?

[tf]               "AUGH! A spell of dizziness!" Dexter cries out as his $HANDS$ shoot up to his temples. His skull starts to mold itself into more sunken, weathered version of itself, losing any boyish immaturity it may have had. Strangely, Dexter doesn't seem to realise what has changed, or at least is trying to ignore it.;

Instead, he just grimaces as his face stretches out a bit height-wise, giving him a long, broad, look. Almost a 'horseface', even though it's nothing compared to the actual 'horsefaces' you've seen leaving the show.;

He slowly dabs a finger to it, before putting it in his mouth to confirm to himself that it is indeed blood. The host offers him a washcloth, but Dexter shoves him aside. Through all that action, you never noticed how his eyes have gotten just a little bit bigger, his chin just a little bit smaller. ;
[status]               A fresh, but surprisingly well healed scar runs down Dexter's eye, and other features of him look just a touch feminine.;

A gash double the size of his eye scar slices his left cheek, the blood gently trickling down in a way that would almost look poetic, were it not for the liquid being blood, and the blood belonging to a face like Dexter's. He licks at it with an unusually thick tongue, before spitting the red saliva at his $FEET$.;

A large golden septum piercing hangs from his nose, with a couple of smaller silver rings on the sides of one of his longer and pointier ears. "Opsrung", Dexter bellows at you, catching you staring. "Heirlooom to Laqh clan.";
[status]               Dexter's face is the exact kind of face you would run away from in a dark alley. Come to think of it, you would run away from it in any location. His butch face is covered in scars presumably won from battle, with the biggest one emblazoned on his left cheek. It looks somewhat bovine, even though the only defining features are his long ears, feral brown eyes, and a big sniffling snout, pierced with an even bigger nose ring. There are subtle clues that point to it being a female's, but in no way does that make it look feminine.;

Surprisingly, Dexter isn't alarmed at this. "Pfhh. Who needs magic when I can beat you with my own two fists?";

Dexter looks happy with the change, as now he won't have to cover them with his $ARMS$. It doesn't seem to matter to his $MIND$ that he's wearing a woman's top.;

[tf]               Dexter whoops in triumph as more muscle forms on his waist, but not without a slight lengthening of his hips. ;
[status]               The faint lines of a sixpack can be seen on Dexter's toned and smooth stomach.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               The lines of Dexter's six pack become more and more visible, the individual pecs bulging out from his stomach. He grins as he rubs his hands over the individual bumps, still unaware of his increasingly childrearing hips.;
[status]               Dexter now sports a clear and muscly six pack.;

[WaitFor]           mind 3;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Instead of more muscle growing on Dexter's waist, some fat pours on there instead, hiding the six pack he's attained, but still looking as strong as ever, as shown when Dexter beats it haughtily with his $HANDS$.;
[status]               Dexter has a lot of weight on his belly, but in no means is it out of shape. On the contrary, it's packed with enough muscle to form around someone else's entire body.;

[tf]               Dexter clenches, and a long ropey tail comes bursting out of his $PANTS$.;
[status]               Dexter has a cow tail drooping lazily behind him, sometimes snapping at his $LEGS$ as if it just killed a fly.;

[tf]               You see Dexter's $SHIRT$ move out slightly in the back as his butt becomes a more regular shape.;
[status]               Even with it being hidden by his $SHIRT$, you can tell that Dexter's butt has grown bigger.;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               "Another one lost!" Dexter cries out triumphantly, and with the swelling of his glutes, you know why he's so excited. He feels up his butt in much of the same way one would grope a woman's butt, before realising what he was doing and abruptly stopping, a sheepish blush on his $FACE$.;
[status]               Dexter has a fit jogger's rear end. ;

[tf]               Dexter's ass grows further out, this time with fat as well as the usual muscle. Dexter looks to be a little wary of how big it's getting, before a wolfwhistle is spouted from the audience, which for some reason makes it okay in his $MIND$.;
[status]               Dexter has a big, plump ass. It would look womanly if it wasn't clear that so much of its mass is muscle.;

[tf]               Dexter stomps his foot in rage as another round is lost, before stopping to regain his balance. The cause of his unsteadiness is his now bulbous asscheeks, and with one grope, he appears to forget his anger.;
[status]               Dexter's ass is the biggest part about him, excluding his $BREASTS$. Contrary to the ass he had a few rounds ago, it looks very feminine, even with all the muscle.;

[tf]               Dexter eagerly moons you and the audience as he shows off his still growing glutes. Just when you think they've stopped expanding, they swell up again, until they resemble pillows more than cheeks. For some reason, a juicy steak appears in your mind... Nope, focus...;
[status]               Dexter has an ass that is thick with a capital T and several exclamation points. It's large enough for the cheeks to be seen peeking out from his already wide hips. Though judging on how it moves in his $PANTS$, you aren't sure how much of it is fat and how much is pure muscle.;

[Desc]               <blue>Nicolas is, to the average eye, an average looking guy in his early 20's. Despite his cool height of 5 feet, 11 inches, his thin limbs leave no room to be imposing. You can guess that he prefers intellectual pursuits over physical - he may have an advantage in a few of the games ahead. He appears to have a few friends in the audience cheering him on - from college, perhaps? You look at him to catch a friendly smile. "I hear that losses cascade here once people get distracted by the changes. Let's try to keep our head in the game, yeah?" he says. You nod absently, wondering how he might end up changing.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>Nicolas stands changed before you, grinning happily as she looks over her new body. She appears to be answering to Nicole now, and she approaches you with a youthful bounce in her step. "You played really well!" she chimes, "I guess I couldn't follow my own advice." Despite her changed priorities, she doesn't appear to have lost any of her original intelligence. You agree, congratulating her on her own efforts. She coos in responsle, swaying in a manner which deliberately swishes her dress against her legs. She looks at you with a gleam in her eyes. "Can we be friends?" she asks. You barely have to consider your answer. How can you say no to a face that cute? She meows happily, leaping into a hug. After holding you for a pleasantly long time, she gives your cheek an affectionate lick before bounding off the stage toward her friends. She immediately begins to make out with the first one she reaches, bringing a chuckle out of your lips. It looks like Nicole's going to be just fine, and certainly not alone.</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               He doesn't have the deepest voice you've ever heard, but it clearly belongs to a man.;
[short]               regular voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Nicolas coughs a little. In his answer to one of the host's questions, you notice that his voice has taken on a slightly higher timbre.;
[status]               His voice is a bit higher, but it could still easily belong to a man.;
[short]               slightly high voice;
[tgShade]            voice 20;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Nicolas coughs again, the change to his voice making itself obvious from that alone. Higher still, it sounds like it could belong to a man or a woman.;
[status]               His voice is high enough that you'd have trouble guessing his gender during a phone call.;
[short]               androgynous voice;
[tgShade]            voice 40;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Nicolas clutches his neck after the latest loss. You aren't sure what changed until he removes them, showing that his adam's apple has nearly disappeared. Fittingly, his voice has taken on a downright girlish timbre in the process.;
[status]               His voice now sits in a more feminine pitch, high and lilting.;
[short]               feminine voice;
[tgShade]            voice 60;
[WaitFor]           face 4;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               After feeling another tingle in his throat, Nicolas tests his voice again. The result reveals a sweet, lilting soprano, causing him to put his $HANDS$ over his mouth.;
[status]               He has a sweet, feminine voice.;
[short]               sweet feminine voice;
[tgShade]            voice 80;
[WaitFor]           face 5;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Nicolas tenses for a moment, but no change appears obvious. He appears lost in thought for a moment, until a sudden address from the host surprises him. He lets out what distinctly sounds like a meow in his surprise. You believe for a moment that he's lost his voice entirely, until he apologizes in the sweet voice he had before this moment. It seems that he is capable of meowing, but not compelled to.;
[status]               In tying with the feline features he already possesses, his sweet feminine voice is now capable of meowing. His speaking usually doesn't include them, but meows tend to slip out when he's surprised or otherwise overwhelmed by emotion.;
[short]               sweet feline voice;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[WaitFor]           custom1 4;

[SHOULDERS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               His shoulders are a bit wide, but nothing remarkable.;
[short]               regular shoulders;
[tgShade]            shoulders 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               A small crunch reverberates through the room as Nicolas' shoulders narrow slightly, rendering his frame just that bit more narrow.;
[status]               His shoulders have narrowed slightly, contributing to an androgynous image.;
[short]               narrow shoulders;
[tgShade]            shoulders 50;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Nicolas' shoulders narrow once again, completely exiting masculinity as they gain gentle curves.;
[status]               His shoulders are narrow and feminine, complementing the rest of his changes well.;
[short]               gently curved shoulders;
[tgShade]            shoulders 100;
[WaitFor]           shirt 3;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               He's got a pair of normal feet in his $SHOES$.;
[short]               normal feet;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Much like his $LEGS$, you see Nicolas rapidly shake his shoes around. With a huff, he gives up and just takes them off, brushing off a layer of hair that detached from them in the scuffle.;
[status]               His feet are hairless, but otherwise unchanged. They continue to fit his $SHOES$ just fine.;
[short]               normal, hairless feet;
[tgShade]            feet 20;
[WaitFor]           legs 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Nicolas shuffles on his feet a little, and you catch him nearly stepping out of his $SHOES$. It would appear that his lower extremities have shrunk.;
[status]               His feet have shrunk, but you can't tell if that's the only way they've changed.;
[short]               small, hairless feet;
[tgShade]            feet 40;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Nicolas sits down and takes his feet out of his loose $SHOES$. Since his socks are gone, you can easily tell that they're shrinking further. Once they finish, they've gone from small to delicate, with a defined arch and gentle curves.;
[status]               There's no way you can describe his feet except for female. He keeps them in his $SHOES$ with slight embarrassment.;
[short]               delicate feet;
[tgShade]            feet 60;
[WaitFor]           shoes 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Nicolas shuffles on his feet once again. With his $SHOES$ still covering them you can't tell how they've changed, but he seems to be uncomfortable with his feet flat on the ground. Perhaps a pair of heels is in order?;
[status]               His female feet seem to be having trouble keeping flat on the ground. You keep catching him raising into his tip toes until he notices and slams them back down on the floor.;
[short]               delicate feet that are more comfortable in heels;
[tgShade]            feet 80;
[WaitFor]           legs 3;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Now that his $SHOES$ have an open toe, you can easily see light blue nail polish adorn his toes. In addition, he once again looks uncomfortable with the current height of his heels. Do his changed feet want them even higher?;
[status]               His delicate feet are enhanced by light blue nail polish and appear to be most at home in 4 or 5 inch heels. ;
[short]               delicate feet that are only comfortable in heels;
[tgShade]            feet 100;
[WaitFor]           shoes 3;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               He's the kind of guy who doesn't really take anything seriously... until it's time to get serious. He seems to have a thing for cats, if his shirt is any indication.;
[short]               carefree mind;
[tgShade]            mind 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Nicolas' eyes glaze over for a moment, and he shakes his head. The host asks him how he feels, but he isn't sure what changed. He does seem to be less tense, as if the changes he's experienced so far are no longer bothering him as much.;
[status]               He still appears to be rather carefree, but you think that his changes are distracting him a little less. Is he becoming more accepting of his situation?;
[short]               carefree, accepting mind;
[tgShade]            mind 25;
[WaitFor]           custom4 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Nicolas asks the host with his $VOICE$ if he can take a short break. The host accepts, and he darts off the stage and hugs one of his friends. He mutters a thanks to them and steps back to his podium, looking satisfied.;
[status]               He seems to be sporting a newfound desire for physical affection. A good hug seems to calm that down rather easily.;
[short]               carefree, affectionate mind;
[tgShade]            mind 50;
[WaitFor]           body 2;
[WaitFor]           custom3 3;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Nicolas looks down at himself and smiles slightly. He's much more accepting of his changes, but that doesn't seem to be all that's changed - the fidget that you've come to associate with his desire for hugs seems to be coming up more quickly than usual.;
[status]               His mind has changed significantly, his carefree nature melding easily with his increasing femininity and desire for affection.;
[short]               feminine, affectionate mind;
[tgShade]            mind 75;
[WaitFor]           groin 4;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Nicolas has been taking advantage of every break in the game to share casual affections with her friends in the audience, but this time she steals a kiss from one of them too. The friend is surprised, but she's grinning like the cat that ate the canary. She spins around happily, letting her $SHIRT$ billow around her $LEGS$. She appears perfectly content to be female, and extremely comfortable with sharing physical affection. When the host asks if she wishes to continue, all she can vocalize in her happiness is an excited meow.;
[status]               Her mind is entirely female and extremely affectionate. There's hardly a care in her mind and a smile almost permanently rests on her $FACE$.;
[short]               female, affectionate mind;
[tgShade]            mind 100;
[WaitFor]           groin 5;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               His hands have short nails and small callouses on most of his fingers. Clearly from a lifelong use of keyboards.;
[short]               slightly calloused hands;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Nicolas brushes the tops of his hands free of hair. No other changes seem to occur.;
[status]               His regular and slightly calloused hands are now free of hair.;

[WaitFor]           arms 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               The callouses on Nicolas' hands fade away and his nails look better maintained. They now have a cleaner look.;
[status]               His hands are now smooth, with well kept nails.;
[short]               smooth, well kept hands;
[tgShade]            hands 50;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Nicolas rubs his fingers together, watching as they becoming longer and slimmer. His nails grow out slightly, but remain well kept. They look rather dainty now.;
[status]               His hands are more slender than they used to be, with well kept nails that extend slightly past his fingers. They aren't exactly masculine.;
[short]               dainty hands;
[tgShade]            hands 75;
[WaitFor]           arms 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Nicolas' hands slim further, his nails gaining a coat of light blue nail polish. They look striking when he runs them through his $HAIR$.;
[status]               His hands are slim, slender, and shapely. With light blue nail polish on his well kept nails, they're perfectly feminine.;

[tgShade]            hands 100;
[WaitFor]           arms 3;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               He's wearing a regular pair of jeans. You can't tell much about the shape of his $LEGS$ through them.;
[short]               jeans;
[tgShade]            pants 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Nicolas' pants cease to be pants entirely, becoming a pair of jean shorts that end around his knee.;
[status]               He's wearing a regular pair of shorts, which reveals some of his $LEGS$.;
[short]               shorts;
[tgShade]            pants 25;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Nicolas' shorts shrink further, only going halfway down his thighs. It exposes much of his $LEGS$.;
[status]               His shorts are on the shorter side, only going halfway down his thighs. His $LEGS$ are well exposed.;

[tgShade]            pants 50;
[WaitFor]           legs 1;
[WaitFor]           shoes 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Nicolas' shorts rise even further, becoming a pair of short shorts that expose the entirety of his legs. Even the hem of his $SHIRT$ goes lower.;
[status]               He's wearing a pair of barely-there shorts that, considering that his $SHIRT$ is covering them, may as well be underwear.;
[short]               barely-there shorts;
[tgShade]            pants 75;
[WaitFor]           legs 2;
[WaitFor]           shoes 3;
[WaitFor]           shirt 5;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               When Nicolas feels another sensation near his $GROIN$, he naively lifts his $SHIRT$ to find that his shorts have disappeared entirely. Realizing that he just showed his $CUSTOM3$ to the audience, he quickly drops the dress, blushing brightly.;
[status]               He is no longer wearing any shorts, his $SHIRT$ adequately performing their previous job.;
[short]               non-existent shorts;
[tgShade]            pants 100;

[GROIN];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               His penis makes itself known inside his $PANTS$. It doesn't seem very remarkable, but it probably works for him.;
[short]               unremarkable penis;
[tgShade]            groin 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Nicolas looks more uncomfortable than usual, and you realize why when he carefully pulls the front of his $PANTS$ aside to look at his penis. "Even here!?" he exclaims, making you believe that he's lost hair there too.;
[status]               You aren't certain, but you believe that his penis is now hairless.;
[short]               hairless, unremarkable penis;
[tgShade]            groin 20;
[WaitFor]           face 1;

[WaitFor]           waist 2;
[WaitFor]           breasts 2;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               A look of discomfort once again cross Nicolas' face. He starts to reach for his groin, but stops short. This guides you to the source of his change - the bulge in his $PANTS$ is rather less bulgy.;
[status]               His hairless penis has clearly shrunk, leaving him very uncertain as to the future of the game.;
[short]               small, hairless penis;

[WaitFor]           custom4 1;
[WaitFor]           body 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               The bulge in his $PANTS$ lessens once more, becoming nearly non-existent. If there's anything left of his penis, it's in no shape to pleasure anyone.;
[status]               His penis has shrunk considerably and leaves almost no impression in his $PANTS$.;
[short]               nearly non-existent penis;

[WaitFor]           custom5 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               A wave of energy seems to fill Nicolas, causing him to moan out loud in his $VOICE$. Once he recovers, his hands shoot straight for his groin. Whatever he finds there, it causes him to recoil instantly. When pressed, he admits that he thinks he's starting to develop a vagina.;
[status]               His penis no longer exists. Instead, a vagina is developing in its place. His $CUSTOM3$ presses against his crotch in a way he's never felt before.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               With another wave of sensation, Nicolas collapses on the podium. With a quick movement of his $ARMS$, he confirms what yourself and the audience has already guessed: his vagina is fully functional, rendering him the latest of many women this show has created.;
[status]               A perfectly normal vagina sits underneath her $CUSTOM3$ and $SHIRT$. It's probably still hairless from the first changes to happen to her. The thought of that feature attached to her otherwise cute body confuses you.;

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               He is thin and lanky, looking more like a pole than anything else. He stands at a cool 5 foot 11.;
[short]               thin body;
[tgShade]            body 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Nicolas stumbles a little, the movement masking the fact that he lost two inches. He stands at 5 foot 9 inches now.;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Nicolas lurches once again. This time, he's lost 3 inches, ending at 5 foot 6. You also notice that his entire build is slightly more delicate, as if his bones themselves are thinner.;
[status]               He now stands at a shorter 5 foot 6. He is also thinner overall, making him look more delicate.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Nicolas shrinks another two inches, but none of it appears to have come from his $LEGS$. With this change in his proportions, his frame looks downright girlish.;
[status]               He is on the short side, standing at a delicate 5 foot 4. His body proportions have shifted to something more feminine, his $LEGS$ appearing longer and his torso thinner.;

[tgShade]            shoes 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Nicolas' shoes shrink to fit his $FEET$ without any change in style. Curiously, he no longer appears to be wearing socks.;
[status]               His sneakers are smaller, fitting his $FEET$ well. His socks have disappeared, too.;

[tf]               Nicolas' shoes shift, becoming a pair of flat open toed sandals. Their color lightens, trending closer to white.;
[status]               His $FEET$ are easily visible in his new open toed sandals. With feet so delicate, you're almost disappointed that there's no heel to speak of.;

[WaitFor]           feet 3;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Nicolas' shoes lighten further, becoming a vibrant white. The heels raise nearly three inches, which seems to solve the problems he previously had regarding his $FEET$ being flat against the floor.;
[status]               He's now wearing a pair of white three inch heels, beautifully showing off his $FEET$.;

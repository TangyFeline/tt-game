[Desc]               <blue>You smell your opponent before you see him. A foul stench that smells like a busy, messy farm. You soon trace the scent to your opponent, Chase Gramen, with a blunt in his hand and a stupid look on his face. "Hmm? Oh, the bud. The people outside said it'd be okay to smoke here. I'd pass it, but y'know... opponents and shit, right?" He bursts out in laughter at the joke that he believes he just told. You severely doubt the security letting him smoke, as well as him 'passing the joint', but you steel yourself as you get ready for what should be a very quick game, so long as that horrible smell doesn't ruin your concentration.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>With that final change, the show is over. Chase, now Chiasa, has turned from a stoner slob to a clean lolita catgirl, quite a change indeed. She curtsies to you, saying something that you don't understand as she takes her umbrella and trots off daintily. You try to find her weeks after to touch base, but hear that she 'moved back' to Japan after finding the West too confusing, although not without giving a few retailers ideas for new sections in their clothing outlets. Although you're disappointed that she's gone, you know she'll be happier there, perhaps even happier than Chase ever was.</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Chase has the typical stoner's voice attained by copious amounts of weed. He sometimes laughs at things for no reason.;
[short]               raspy, chuckling voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Chase starts coughing violently and grossly, taking consideration to cough in his sleeve, but not enough to clean up the black and sticky lump that ends up on it. "Well, that w- whoooah... My voice..." Sure enough, his voice sounds much less scratchy, although he'll have a ways to go before he can consider an opera career.;
[status]               Chase's voice has healed significantly, but a bit of raspiness sometimes leaks out in his words.;
[short]               healing voice;
[tgShade]            voice 20;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Chase coughs yet again, but unlike the last whooping cough he had where it sounded like a lung was being thrown up, this cough sounds lighter, like he just caught something in his throat. Sure enough, when he recovers, his voice has gotten just a bit higher, as well as healing up completely from his smoking. You could swear that even his adam's apple is less prominent...;
[status]               Chase's voice has healed from his endless nights of weed, but has gotten a touch higher in return. Chase is clearly concerned by this, and is far less vocal than normal.;
[short]               clear and higher voice;
[tgShade]            voice 40;
[WaitFor]           mind 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Chase tries to keep a cough in, but it's too much, as he half chokes, half sneezes into his elbow. It takes a lot of prodding from the host to get him to speak, and once he does, you hear why he was hiding his voice. It is now breezy, high, and very, very feminine, like a tittering schoolgirl. A carmine blush comes over Chase's $FACE$, as you see a rather smooth section of skin where his adam's apple would be.;
[status]               Chase's voice is now the voice of a girl's, no question. It isn't just that it is higher and gentler (and it surely is both),  but the inflections on his words have changed, raising pitch on odd parts that would sound unusual on a guy. And indeed, it does sound weird.;
[short]               high and sweet voice;
[tgShade]            voice 60;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Chase lets out a cute little sneeze that seems to surprise him more than the audience. When he apologises, you and the audience hear the change, even if Chase himself doesn't. His voice has taken on some slight Asian qualities that only stand out for an attentive ear.;
[status]               Chase has a slight Japanese accent whenever he opens his mouth.;
[short]               sweet voice with a Japanese accent;
[tgShade]            voice 80;
[WaitFor]           mind 5;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               "Mew? Oh, I guess nothing changed this time, nya..." Chase pouts with a sullen expression, failing to hear his new vocal mannerisms.;
[status]               Chase has a beautiful and delicate voice with a bit of an accent and a huge tendency to say 'nya' at the ends of sentences alongside other things. He doesn't seem to notice that he's doing it, and any attempts to explain it to him are greeted with confused eyes and a meow of confusion.;
[short]               sweet and catty voice;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[WaitFor]           face 6;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have no idea what Chase's feet look like, as they're currently in his $SHOES$.;
[short]               average feet;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               "Dude, did I get a pebble in my shoe?" Chase drawls as he shifts uncomfortably. "In... both shoes?";
[status]               Chase looks to be having trouble with his feet.;
[short]               irritated feet;
[tgShade]            feet 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               "Ok, this is too weird, dude. I gotta let the dogs breathe." Before the host can stop him, Chase kneels down to take off his shoes, revealing feet that couldn't have possibly belonged to him at the start. His feet are slim, smooth, and entirely feminine. He puts back on his shoes, rubbing his eyes as if what he was seeing was some sort of bad trip.;
[status]               Chase literally has a pair of girl's feet inside his $SHOES$.;
[short]               girly feet;
[tgShade]            feet 66;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               "Oh no! My toenails!" Chase cries out as he cautiously, nimbly takes off his shoes and socks. He then raises a foot nearly towards his head as he blows on the now pink toenails, before lowering it with a sigh of relief. "Thank goodness. They are already dry.";
[status]               Like his $HANDS$, Chase's toes are pink and clawed. He has small feet, even for a girl.;
[short]               dainty feet with long pink toenails;
[tgShade]            feet 100;
[WaitFor]           shoes 4;
[WaitFor]           hands 3;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Chase's mind is as concrete and focused as the smoke that pours from his lips. With every round or change, the host has to jolt him awake to get him back in the game, and he's obviously more concerned about his high than anything else, although he looks to be one who's indefinitely, incurably under the influence. On the bright side, nothing seems to be getting him down, in the sense that there might not be enough braincells in him to cause emotions like sadness or fear.;
[short]               high and dumb mind;
[tgShade]            mind 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Chase stands motionless staring through the walls, as he does with every round's end, but this time he starts to blink rapidly, as if getting rid of sand in his eyes. When he stops, his eyes look clearer. "Bummer. Looks like the high's wearin' off.";
[status]               While you wouldn't trust Chase to operate heavy machinery, he seems to be more focused in the game now, perhaps due to the rest of the changes inflicting his $BODY$.;
[short]               more focused mind;
[tgShade]            mind 14;
[WaitFor]           body 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Chase's eyes glaze once more, before filling with a heightened awareness. It looks like his high is about to end. "Uhh, guys? These changes are cool and all, but what's really goin' on?";
[status]               Chase's mind looks to have almost gotten clear of his high.;
[short]               nearly sober mind;
[tgShade]            mind 28;
[WaitFor]           groin 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You start to wonder if Chase will ever gain cognizance of the changes inflicting him, as he stare out into space yet again. When he comes to, however, it's a whole different story. His eyes no longer look glazed and dumb, instead focused and scared. "Okay," he sibilates worriedly. "There's been something going on, has'nt there? I'm looking down, there's all these changes on me..." He pauses to let out a racking cough, and looks at his $CUSTOM2$. "Jesus, I need to lay off of these...";
[status]               Chase has completely recovered from his high, and is now quite nervous of the game and what it has in store for him.;
[short]               scared mind;
[tgShade]            mind 42;
[WaitFor]           breasts 2;
[WaitFor]           butt 2;
[WaitFor]           groin 2;

[WaitFor]           feet 2;
[WaitFor]           arms 2;
[WaitFor]           face 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Ever since Chase lost his penis, he's been looking more and more downtrodden, as to be expected. This round is no different, as he stares out into nothing in the same way as he used to while high. He snaps out of it, he's almost a new person, with a focused gaze and a straightened spine. "It doesn't matter. I will win this game." Wait, it doesn't matter? Where did this come from? You ponder his sudden change in mood as Chase dotes over the shape of his nails...;
[status]               Chase has started to act more and more girly ever since his his penis disappeared. Understandable, you suppose, as he's lost most of his testosterone.;
[short]               effeminate mind;
[tgShade]            mind 57;
[WaitFor]           face 4;
[WaitFor]           groin 4;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Chase again falls under a trances, his eyes lidded and unaware, before again coming to his senses. He looks around at the audience, but nothing seems to have changed in either them or him. You are about to consider this round's changes a dud before he looks back on his fingernails with a confused expression. "I swore I done these this morning... surely they couldn't be tarnished already?" As he spends more time examining his nails, your question is answered.;
[status]               Chase officially thinks of himself as a girl, and a rather elegant one at that. Not a moment is spent without him fixing his $HAIR$, doing up his $FACE$, checking his $HANDS$... it's almost exhausting to watch.;
[short]               girl's mind;
[tgShade]            mind 71;
[WaitFor]           pants 4;
[WaitFor]           shoes 4;
[WaitFor]           face 5;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Chase is about to look at his fingernails for probably the hundredth time before his $HANDS$ drop to his sides, his $FACE$ blank. He stands there for so long that the host looks worried, and lightly touches his shoulder, after which he jumps back with an "Eeehh?! Doshitano?" Looking at the startled faces of the audience he recovers a little, clearing his throat with a cute, but strangely animal cough. "I am sorry. But don't surprise a young lady like that!";
[status]               Based on his last change, it's safe to say that Chase (well, he now responds to Chiasa Koneko, but you can't pronounce that, so you'll keep referring to him as Chase) now believes himself to be a Japanese girl. But some other things have happened that give you pause, like him darting around at glimmers of light, or how he licks his $FACE$ with his tongue a bit too well...;
[short]               foreign mind;
[tgShade]            mind 85;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               Chase has spent the last few minutes staring dully at the wall, a smile on his $FACE$. The host is too scared to prod him again, so you're all stuck waiting until he wakes up, yawning big enough to show off his fangs. "Sorry. I only got fourteen hours of sleep last night, nyah." He licks his lips, and uses his teeth to straighten out a sleeve on his $SHIRT$.;
[status]               The former Chase Gramen is now Chiasa Koneko, a catgirl dressed in an outfit too formal for even a televised gameshow. You think you heard somewhere that it's a 'lolita style', popular in Japan, that emphasizes Victorian styles as well as elegance. Chase has elegance in spades, with his quiet and introverted demeanour.;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Burn marks and ash cover the skin on Chase's hands, their fingernails yellow and cracked.;
[short]               gnarled hands;
[tgShade]            hands 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You watch Chase's $CUSTOM2$-less hand start to heal over the scars and burns, until it is smooth and regenerated. You assume that the other hand 'suffered' the same fate.;
[status]               Chase's hands are smooth and healed, even if you doubt they'll stay that way if Chase continues his smoking.;
[short]               smooth hands;
[tgShade]            hands 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Since Chase has his $HANDS$ in his pockets, you don't see this round's change right away. Once he takes one out to unconsciously play with his $HAIR$, you see the change. They are thinner, smaller, and girlier, with longer fingers.;
[status]               Chase has a pair of very womanly hands that he hasn't noticed yet.;
[short]               thin and girly hands;
[tgShade]            hands 66;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Chase has been waiting for this change for a while. His fingernails grow out, coloured with a shiny pink. Chase coos at them, while you wonder why they've gotten so long and sharp.;
[status]               Chase's hands have long fingers and sharp pink nails that look a bit too much like claws.;
[short]               small hands with clawlike pink nails;
[tgShade]            hands 75;
[WaitFor]           mind 5;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Chase claps his hands with giddiness as frilly blue wristcuffs appear below her hands.;
[status]               Chase has soft hands that look very well-maintained. His nails are long, pink, and sharp, and frilly wristcuffs complete the look.;
[short]               dainty hands with long pink fingernails and wristcuffs;
[tgShade]            hands 100;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Chase wears a pair of dirty jeans that have stains of various shapes and colours, but mostly green and black. You have a weird feeling that he isn't wearing any underwear...;
[short]               stained jeans;
[tgShade]            pants 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Just like his $SHIRT$, Chase's pants lose their numerous stains, cleaning up to become a more presentable pair of jeans.;
[status]               All of the stains on Chase's pants have been washed away. ;
[short]               clean jeans;
[tgShade]            pants 20;
[WaitFor]           shirt 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Chase "Ooomfs!" as his jeans tighten dangerously around his $LEGS$ and $GROIN$. They look like they are several sizes too short for him, a pair of skinny jeans.;
[status]               Chase wears a pair of uncomfortable looking skinny jeans that make his lack of underwear even more apparent.;
[short]               blue skinny jeans;
[tgShade]            pants 40;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Chase's skinny jeans creep up his $LEGS$, making him wince as they get closer and closer to his $GROIN$. Fortunately for him, they stop just above the knee, where they fade to a more washed out blue.;
[status]               Chase is wearing a pair of pale blue jorts that almost look like a women's cut.;
[short]               pale blue jorts;
[tgShade]            pants 60;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Chase's jorts shorten until you can no longer see them under his $SHIRT$. When cameras try to sneak a peek, Chase goes off on them, angrily spouting about his privacy. Of course, due to his $VOICE$, it sounds more cute than threatening.;
[status]               You can't see what undergarments Chase is wearing due to it being covered by his $SHIRT$.;

[WaitFor]           shirt 4;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Chase's $SHIRT$ suddenly poofs out as what you assume to be a petticoat appears. At the same time, a pair of white bloomers show up. Chase looks down on them proudly, making a hissing noise at the audience. "Will teach you to try and look up a lady's dress, nyaa.";
[status]               Chase wears a pair of bloomers that form perfectly with her tights. He uses a petticoat to further pop out her $SHIRT$.;

[GROIN];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               There is a small, but definitely noticeable bulge in Chase's $PANTS$. ;
[short]               visible bulge;
[tgShade]            groin 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Chase's penis bulges out in a visible erection. All Chase does to react to it is chuckle gutturally.;
[status]               Chase has the bulge of an erection in his $PANTS$.;

[tgShade]            groin 20;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Chase buckles over with an exhale of elation, panting as if he'd run a marathon. When he gets up, you see a very naughty stain on the front of his $PANTS$, but strangely, no bulge.;
[status]               Chase still has the 'excitement' of last round on the front of his $PANTS$, but his penis has gotten smaller from the action.;
[short]               smaller penis;
[tgShade]            groin 40;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               "No..." Chase whimpers pathetically as he puts his $HANDS$ to his crotch. He keeps them there for quite a while, until he's forced to use his hands for the next round, in which you see nary a bulge in sight in his $PANTS$. While you have no reason to assume it's gone completely, his penis has definitely gotten a downgrade.;
[status]               Chase no longer has a bulge of any kind in the front of his $PANTS$.;
[short]               unnoticeable, but surely small penis;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Chase scrunches his $FACE$ up, before letting loose a tirade of panicked exclamations. "It's gone! How'd it... It's GONE!!" He even strips off his $PANTS$ for everyone to see, and while yes, his penis is gone, instead of the lady parts you were expecting, there's... nothing. Like a mannequin. Despite there not being anything to cover up, Chase looks to be embarrassed at his nudity, and puts his pants back on in shame.;
[status]               Chase has... nothing between his legs. Nothing. Just a patch of smooth skin. This raises too many questions for your own mind to even begin to comprehend, so how many questions does it raise in Chase's $MIND$?;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               A look of vexation appears on Chase's $FACE$ as he crosses his $LEGS$ tightly. The moment passes as quickly as it began, but even though Chase pays it no mind, you know exactly what changed...;
[status]               For some reason, it feels very weird and almost wrong to think about Chase's vagina. He looks cute, but not sexual, so his private areas never cross your mind.;

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               It's clear that Chase is out of shape. He has a layer of pudge all over his body, and stands in a slouch that must be comfortable for him, even if it looks rather uncomfortable to everyone else. Even with all this, you can see that he is quite young, no older than 20. ;
[short]               slightly fat, 5'10 body;
[tgShade]            body 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               With all the individual parts changing, it's about time for Chase's body to get the picture as well. Not only does he lose weight, however, but a little bit of his height. Could this be the change that wakes him from his stupor?;
[status]               Chase has lost a lot of his weight, and a couple of inches to boot.;
[short]               typical, 5'8 body;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Another couple of inches is shaved from Chase's height, with a bit more padding alongside it. Chase looks confused on the size difference, but he doesn't ruminate on it.;
[status]               Chase has lost another 2 inches, and the remaining body fat hanging off his frame has been put in more healthy places.;
[short]               thinner 5'6 body;

[STAGE] 3;

"Dude, y'know when you take a hit, and it feels like you've been socked in the face?" Apparently not, although he is brushing the now pale silver hair out of his eyes. So he does know about his hair, but he just doesn't care about it...;

Whatever he was talking about doesn't look to be the reason for the strain, though, as his face shortens inwards, leaving him with a face that look even more youthful. Once he unscrunches his face, the wrinkles disappear, too. Chase checks out his new face in the mirror with more curiosity than fear. "Crazy shit...";

His nose shortens again, now a cute little button, while any remaining cheekbones are fleshed out to better accommodate his smooth and rosy cheeks. His eyes are the last to change, growing again while taking on an amber hue. Chase looks in the mirror, and nearly falls from the shock of his new look.;
[status]               Chase has gone past the androgynous look and landed straight into girly, with big, inviting eyes and sweet lips. There are still some features on him remaining from the beginning of the game, but their time is clearly limited.;

When he looks up, teary-eyed but contented, you can see just how severe the changes are. Not only has his face turned completely feminine, with a nice coating of makeup, but his facial structure has been altered to that of someone of Asian descent. Now you have no idea what the changes are leading up to...;

[status]               Chase has a corset keeping his waist in line, although you're 100% positive it's just there for fashion. Even though he takes soft, controlled breaths, it's clear that he's comfortable with it on.;

[status]               Chase has a very smelly blunt in his hand. Every so often he takes a gulp from it, holding it in for several seconds before expelling it out with a loud, gross cough.;

[tf]               Chase takes another breath of his blunt, before coughing wildly before he even inhales. It appears the blunt has fattened and lengthened, turning into an expensive looking cigar. Poor Chase. He looks like his parents were killed in front of his eyes.;
[status]               Chase's weed has been replaced with a cigar. Needless to say, he's not dealing with it well.;

[tf]               With a sudden poof of pink smoke, Chase's cigar gains a long cigarette holder. Chase shrugs and keeps using it, daintily holding it between his fingers.;
[status]               Chase smokes from a long cigarette holder, perhaps the longest you've ever seen.;

[tf]               Chase's long forgotten cigarette holder grows longer and longer, until the end pops out into a parasol. He twirls it around for a bit, before closing it and putting it away. "It is bad luck to open a parasol indoors.";
[status]               A closed pink and blue parasol sits at Chase's $FEET$.;

[BUTT];

[status]               Chase's butt is pretty gross, even for a butt. The cheeks hang unsightly from his back, and can be seen even in his $PANTS$.;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You see movement at the seat of Chase's $PANTS$, and when he turns around, you can see why. His butt has shrunk to a nicer looking size.;
[status]               Chase has an average butt, not too fat, not too flat.;

[tf]               Instead of shrinking some more, Chase's butt regains some of the fat that it once had, but in different places, raising the cheeks up to look much more feminine. Even so, the butt itself does look smaller.;
[status]               Chase has a tiny behind that still looks feminine on him.;

[tf]               For a while you think that nothing has changed on Chase, until you realise that you can't see his butt underneath his $SHIRT$. It appears that it has grown small enough to be completely hidden by his dress.;
[status]               Chase has such a small butt that it doesn't make an impression in his $SHIRT$.;

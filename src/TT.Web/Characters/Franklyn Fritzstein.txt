[Desc]               <blue>Stumbling into the arena is the very definition of nerd. In fact, you're certain you've seen him in a cartoon once. He has it all: long labcoat, black rimmed glasses, wimpy and weak body, the whole works. And when he opens his mouth, your suspicions are answered. "Let me get one thing clear before we begin. My colleague and I are experimenting on altered brainwaves and CNS response on transformed individuals. I have no intention of being the guinea pig in this. It seems futile of me to ask you to lose, but I doubt I will need to." He takes out a black marker, writing 'Name: Franklyn Fritzstein' and 'Occupation: Scientist' below it on the mirror to the side of him. "Now, let us begin."</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>"Are we fucking done?!" Fuki yells out. "I'm SOOOOOO bored. No offense, Sherman babe, but this gameshow's SUPER boring. Got no idea why you wanted me in it." Sherman is about to say something back, but the words get caught in his throat at the sight of the seven foot lizard in front of him. "Uh uh uh, don't need to say a word. Be the time we're done, you'll be fucked so hard you'll forget how."  She leaps off the stage, grabbing Sherman by the collar and racing backstage for what you can assume will be the greatest fifteen minutes of his life... the first of many. And though you don't ever see her again, you do see Sherman the next time you're at the hospital, in bed for what the nurse claims is a 'broken pelvis', though he doesn't look too concerned about it, a dopey smile on his face. Now what could have caused that...?</pink>;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Franklyn's voice is worn and weathered, with a slight nasality that sounds almost stereotypically nerdy.;
[short]               weak voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               This just might be the added confidence Franklyn's gained, but you're sure his voice wasn't this high... after a moment's thought, you remember what kind of game you're in, and then you know exactly why his voice is higher.;
[status]               Franklyn's voice has raised in pitch, but it still sounds like a guy, just a more excitable one.;
[short]               higher, peppier voice;
[tgShade]            voice 20;
[WaitFor]           custom2 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Once again, you hear an added pep and higher pitch to Franklyn's voice, though this time it's clear that the gameshow is doing it, as he almost sounds like an excitable teen... or a woman.;
[status]               Franklyn has a voice that sounds like it comes from an eager and playful woman, and it's not just the higher pitch. He's also gained some feminine inflections to his voice as well.;
[short]               high and girly voice;
[tgShade]            voice 40;
[WaitFor]           breasts 3;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Franklyn's voice shifts its pitch once more, and this time it's obvious that it belongs to a woman. Upon hearing his voice, he nearly swoons, giggling. "Jealous, boys~? This voice only sings for Sherman...";
[status]               Franklyn has a voice that could charm the pants off of a monk. It's almost like she purposefully crafts each word to sound sultrier than the last, licking her lips as she winks to the audience.;
[short]               sultry voice;
[tgShade]            voice 60;
[WaitFor]           groin 6;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               There's an audible buzzing in Franklyn's vocal cords, and suddenly Franklyn is speaking in a lower register, it happening mid-sentence. He brushes it off, snickering in that low voice of hers, raising her volume to compensate.;
[status]               Franklyn talks in a lower, louder voice, though it's most definitely not masculine. She also talks a tiny bit slower, as if she's having trouble coming up with the words.;
[short]               low and loud voice;
[tgShade]            voice 80;
[WaitFor]           custom2 4;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               For a moment, it sounds like Franklyn has trouble speaking, and the reason why is soon revealed, as his teeth have now gained points, much like the predator she's become. "Don't worry babe, I'll still give ya a blowjob you'll never forget...";
[status]               Franklyn talks exactly how you'd think lizards would if they could: low, fierce, and dangerous. His voice, however, has the added trait of sultry lust, purring out his words when he's not growling them.;
[short]               husky and dangerous voice;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[WaitFor]           face 7;
[WaitFor]           mind 8;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Judging by Franklyn's $SHOES$, he has some pretty puny feet for a guy.;
[short]               small feet;
[tgShade]            feet 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Now that Franklyn's $SHOES$ have changed, his feet do the same to compensate, gaining a slight arch to better fit. Once again, he fails to comment.;
[status]               Franklyn's dainty feet seem to be very comfortable in his $SHOES$, due to their natural arch.;
[short]               arched feet;
[tgShade]            feet 25;
[WaitFor]           shoes 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Franklyn's feet continue to adapt to his rather girly $SHOES$, shrinking into a cute and girly pair of feet. But that's not all, as some flashy blue nail polish is applied on his toes.;
[status]               A coat of bright blue polish adorns Franklyn's feminine toes. It looks solid enough that it's hard to tell that it's polish.;
[short]               feminine feet with painted toes;
[tgShade]            feet 50;
[WaitFor]           groin 6;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Even if his stockings are in the way, you can tell that something odd is going on underneath, as you can see hints of his blue toes peeking out from the holes in them, his feet almost misshapen. "How am I gonna show off my toes like this?!" Franklyn cries out, scratching his stockings in the same way he does his gloves.;
[status]               Franklyn's $SHOES$ seem to be fitting oddly, and the spots around the toes look like its about to rip.;
[short]               sharp nailed feet;
[tgShade]            feet 75;
[WaitFor]           hands 4;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Franklyn yells out in pain, collapsing to the floor as his feet literally reshape, the stockings fusing onto them to fit scales over her increasingly reptilian feet. In fact, when she stands up again, they're not feet at all, but sharp lizard claws.;
[status]               Franklyn's feet are the stuff of sharp, reptilian nightmares. While looking vaguely humanoid, her blue scales and piercing claws give off a wildly different look, literally.;
[short]               clawed scaled feet;
[tgShade]            feet 100;
[WaitFor]           shoes 3;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Franklyn's mind is a mixture of the neurotic old scientist and the grumpy old man. Allegedly he's only in his fifties, but the way he carries himself belies his true age. Nevertheless, it's not hard at all to see the fierce, almost intimidating intelligence in his eyes.;
[short]               scientific mind;
[tgShade]            mind 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Franklyn looks down at his $BODY$ as if he'd finally noticed the changes, furrowing his brow. "I don't understand," he mumbles. "All of my research points to NEGATIVE bodily changes following a defeat, and yet..." He doesn't continue, but you can see him start to loosen up.;
[status]               Franklyn looks perplexed about how the changes have progressed so far, but it seems like he's let his guard down slightly because of them. Sometimes, you even catch a smile on his $FACE$ as he looks at his new $BODY$...;
[short]               confused mind;
[tgShade]            mind 12;

[WaitFor]           face 1;
[WaitFor]           hair 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Once again, Franklyn looks down at his $BODY$ in confusion, though it doesn't last. "So... all of these changes occur only when I lose? Heh, heh... lucky for you, then." He addresses you, before putting his $HANDS$ to his mouth in embarrassment. Still, he can't hide the smirk on his $FACE$ from that little taunt...;
[status]               Franklyn has started to get more into the game, taunting you more with each change that inflicts him. But you aren't worried. Pride cometh before the fall, after all...;
[short]               looser mind;
[tgShade]            mind 25;

[WaitFor]           face 2;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               "Ha!" Franklyn suddenly calls out, beaming. "Can't you see? It doesn't matter if I lose, cuz I'll just get a better body from it!" He flexes directly into the cameras, and the audience cheers, spurring him on. You have to admit you're a bit jealous, but you know it can't last...;
[status]               Gone is the quivering and grouchy scientist from before. Now Franklyn has the mind of a confident, almost arrogant showoff, whooping up the crowd as his taunts towards you get less playful.;
[short]               confident mind;
[tgShade]            mind 37;
[WaitFor]           groin 3;

[WaitFor]           body 3;
[WaitFor]           breasts 2;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               "Well well well, we have an admirer here!" Franklyn points to a scrawny nerd in the audience that looks much like how Franklyn did at the start of the round, who timidly waves at him. He must be a colleague, as Franklyn leans on his stand, winking at him. "You sure you didn't make me do this game to show me off, Sherman dear?" His sudden feminine attitude is not lost on the audience, who cheer him on as he giggles.;
[status]               Franklyn's mind is rapidly approaching the fairer sex, as he poses and flaunts his body. He seems to only have eyes for his colleague Sherman, though...;
[short]               girly and promiscuous mind;
[tgShade]            mind 50;
[WaitFor]           groin 4;
[WaitFor]           butt 3;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               "Aw, c'mon, host!" Franklyn pouts, sauntering towards them. "Can't you make a pretty girl's day and give me that last round, pretty please??" The host chuckles, but shakes their head, which only makes Franklyn roll his eyes. "Well, fuck you too, then. Sherman would've let it go, right baby?" Sherman doesn't respond, their face beet red.;
[status]               Franklyn, or Francine, has a mind that fits his $BODY$, as he can't stop flaunting his looks, even if his eyes are now focused on Sherman than the others in the crowd. Though not an uncontrollable nympho, he's definitely not afraid to show off, making kissy faces at Sherman while taunting you and the host.;
[short]               overconfident and feminine mind;

[WaitFor]           breasts 5;
[WaitFor]           voice 3;
[WaitFor]           face 4;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               As the game goes on, you can't help but notice Franklyn's flirting towards Sherman have gotten a bit more... primal? At first it was just about kissing them, hugging them, maybe a bit of foreplay. Now, it's far more dominant, with him talking about "fucking you so hard you'll be in the hospital for months". As to be expected, Sherman isn't pleased with the change, and you have to admit that you're with them on this one...;
[status]               Franklyn's demeanour has gotten a little scary, talking about Sherman as if they were a toy designed to be broken and looking at you as if you were prey.;
[short]               wilder and slower mind;
[tgShade]            mind 75;

[WaitFor]           voice 4;
[WaitFor]           face 5;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               "Hey host." Franklyn bellows out, his eyes having gained a strangely feral look. "Gimme some meat. I'm starving here." Seems like the host was prepared for this very question, since they give Franklyn a slab of meat, still on the bone. "Ya think you've had enough?!" A member of the audience catcalls. Uh oh... it takes five security to restrain Franklyn. "You wanna find out for yourself you piece of shit?! I'll stick my tail so far up your ass it'll pierce your brain!!" After a few minutes of this tirade, he calms down, almost instantly. "Just kidding, sweetheart. I only do that trick for Sherman...";
[status]               Franklyn has definitely gained a more aggressive demeanour, with him lashing out at audience members before laughing it off. Every so often, he tears into another slab of meat, throwing the bones to the floor.;
[short]               hungry and horny mind;
[tgShade]            mind 87;

[WaitFor]           face 6;
[WaitFor]           hair 3;
[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               The host has to gently prod Franklyn, as he stares into space. "Whuh? Whass goin' on?" The host explains that he lost another round, and his $FACE$ curls in confusion, before nodding. "Ah, right. This bullshit. No offense. Y'know I'm only doing this for my babe, right? I wouldn't give you the time of fucking day otherwise." The host nervously nods, and Franklyn bursts out in laughter, 'playfully' punching them hard enough for them to stumble back. "Just kidding, ya fucking dope! Jee SUS, you humans are dumb as... as rocks. Yeah.";
[status]               Franklyn has the mind of an apex predator. A very hungry, VERY horny predator. When he's not bragging to the audience about his boyfriend Sherman, he's sizing up you and the crowd as if he was about to tear into you at any moment, before laughing it off, as if it was a joke you just didn't get.;

[HANDS];

[status]               Franklyn's hands are weathered and rough. Clearly they aren't well taken care of.;

[tgShade]            hands 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Franklyn flinches, raising his hands to his $FACE$ as they heal themselves of any chemical scars and stains. "This needs further experimentation...";
[status]               Franklyn's hands look fairly normal for a man his age. A little rough around the edges but better looking than before.;

[WaitFor]           groin 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               As if responding to his suddenly feminine $FEET$, Franklyn's hands turn soft and smooth, gaining longer fingers and slimmer palms.;
[status]               Franklyn's hands are smooth and soft, appearing well taken care of, although his fingers are a little too long and slender to be considered manly.;

[WaitFor]           feet 1;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               There's a flash of powerful blue light, and when your vision clears, Franklyn is now wearing a pair of long gloves, worn more for fashion than warmth. "Jealous, girls?" He taunts the audience.;
[status]               Long blue gloves cover Franklyn's feminine hands. From the way he gawks at them, you can tell that it's not an unwelcome addition in his eyes.;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Franklyn grumbles as he scratches his gloves, his hands twitching. "Fuck... so itchy..." Despite his apparent discomfort, he has trouble taking them off, almost as if they're sticking onto his hands...;
[status]               The tips of Franklyn's fingers look like they are about to rip through from the inside. He keeps pulling and tugging on his blue gloves, as it seems like they've gotten too tight, sticking as he pulls. ;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Just like his $FEET$ before him, Franklyn's gloves fuse onto his hands as they turn clawed and reptilian. It looks to be as painful as his former feet, but he only grimaces, probably because the pain didn't come as a surprise this time.;
[status]               Franklyn has a pair of wickedly sharp claws, with blue scales that travel halfway up his $ARMS$. He occasionally rubs them together, as if he was sharpening blades, which isn't that far from the truth.;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Inch by inch, Franklyn's pants slide up his $LEGS$ until they reach his knees, dimming to a pale gray while gaining an almost elastic fabric, much like gym shorts.;
[status]               Franklyn's loose grey shorts stop just before his knees. They are made of a light material that allows his $LEGS$ to breathe. ;

[tf]               Once again, Franklyn's shorts creep up his $LEGS$, darkening in hue until they're a pair of tight boyshorts. It must be incredibly humiliating to have shorts this tight and still not have a bulge in front, but he seems to be taking it in stride.;
[status]               The tight black shorts Franklyn wears are more underwear than outerwear. Clinging tightly to his $BUTT$ and $WAIST$, the fabric barely comes past his $GROIN$. ;

[tf]               Franklyn seems to have had enough of his stretched boyshorts, tearing them off his $BODY$ with a huff. As he does so, tribal markings form around his waist, though you're not sure if they're tattoos or merely body paint. Whatever they are, they all seem to point to his $GROIN$...;
[status]               Franklyn has discarded his shorts entirely, leaving his $GROIN$ exposed. Intricate tribal tattoos encircle his bare hips, and a claw occasionally circles around his open cunt.;

[tf]               It looks like the game's starting off hard, literally. Franklyn covers the front of his $PANTS$ as a rather phallic protrusion juts forth. "I feel I needn't inform you that this is the game's doing...";
[status]               Franklyn has an erection, and you doubt it's from looking out at the crowd.;

[tf]               Franklyn covers his junk with his $HANDS$ once more, but this time his fidgets are a bit twitchier, almost like something is bothering him. Sure enough, when he removes his hands, you can see that his dick is nearly pulsing from arousal, a fierce blush now on his $FACE$.;
[status]               Franklyn's penis is pressing against the front of his $PANTS$, and occasionally he reaches down, only to stop himself just in time.;

You expect a tirade, but receive only a smirk. "This... actually explains a lot. Shame about the size, though.";

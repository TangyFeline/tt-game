Welcome!  So it is the last turn of the game and there are no more updates to the ground.  Now it's time to put the game into chaos mode will new features get added, bugs squashed, stories/quests written, etc etc.

Here is what to do when ending the round:

1.  Assign end-of-the-round badges.  Admins can go to this link to run this automatically:  http://transformania-time.com.plumeria.arvixe.com/PvPAdmin/AssignLeadersBadges .  Note that this will only work when the game is on the very last turn of the round (at the time of writing this, turn 5000/5000) and NOT in chaos mode.  Please make sure to only run this once.

2.  Save the leaderboards.  To save the leaderboard I go into the page's source and copy all information between the opening and closing <table> tags on the page, run the text through an online HTML minifier, and save to a new .cshtml file under the Views/PvP/RoundLeaderboards area.  There are three leaderboards to save:

a) PvP leaderboard, http://transformaniatime.com/PvP/PvPLeaderboard .  The files for this around found straight under the Views/PvP/RoundLeaderboards path.

b) Item leaderboard, http://transformaniatime.com/PvP/ItemLeaderboard .  The files for this around found in Views/PvP/RoundLeaderboards/Items .

c) XP leaderboard, http://transformaniatime.com/PvP/Leaderboard .  The files for this around found in Views/PvP/RoundLeaderboards/XP .

***Note that the leaderboard will attempt to highlight your own name in pink if you have a position on one of these leaderboards.  Removing the styling for your row.  You can do this easy by searching the page source for 'background-color:'

3.  Add links on to the file Views/PvP/partial/OldLeaderboardLinks.cshtml for this past round.  The winner of the era is the first-place winner of a certain achievement which differs each round.  Use the winner's full name including nickname and generation title, ie "Bob 'I Won!' Smith IV".

4.  Save the achivement leaderboard, found at http://transformaniatime.com/Settings/PlayerStatsLeaders .  To do this you should expand every achivement to see the full top 10 of EACH category.  Once this is done, copy all the HTML out from the <div class="row">...</div> below the <h1>Statistics Leaders</h1> markup.  Save this data as a new file under Views/PvP/RoundLeaderboards/Statistics .

5.  Everything should be saved now.  If you have access to the FTP live server, drop this files in the appropriate locations and check that everything is saved correctly.

6.  Write in game news that the round has ended and that the game is entering chaos mode.  Congratulate the winner of the era.

7.  Time for chaos!  Go to this link:  http://transformaniatime.com/PvPAdmin/ChangeWorldStats and check Chaos Mode.  Roll back the turn number back to 0.  The server should instantly register this change and begin chaos mode.

<Description>You are on the stage of the Oldport Concert Hall.  The stage lights are dim but all on, illuminating you while keeping the back walls dark and featureless.  The wooden floor is dented, scuffed, and in some places starting to crack, revealing a hollow area underneath the stage.</Description>

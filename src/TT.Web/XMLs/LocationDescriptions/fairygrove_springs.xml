<Description>The area around here seems so peaceful. The springs here are crystal clear, there are water lilies floating on their surfaces and a few of the fairies are bathing in it. A little stream of water seems to be coming from outside of the grove. That must be how the water gets here from the snowy mountains in the north. Much like at the entrance, the fae here are all rather careful around you. They are softly talking among themselves and keep their eyes on you but they do slowly seem to go about their own business again.</Description>

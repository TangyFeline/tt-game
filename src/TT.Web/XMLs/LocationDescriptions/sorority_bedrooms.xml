<Description>You are now standing in the bedroom of the Sorority House. Affectionately referred to as the trophy case by some of the fraternities at St. Circe, many a pair of panties have been stolen from this very room. There are eight twin beds in this room, but you notice four of them have been pushed together at some point this semester. You see one sorority sister still sleeping in bed, nursing a harsh hangover from last night's party.</Description>

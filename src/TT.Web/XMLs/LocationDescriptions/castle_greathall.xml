<Description>You are in the great hall of Valentine's Castle.  You are in a vast hall filled with many beautiful art pieces. But the one that takes  your breath is the fountain located in the centre of room. A girl is holding a crystal ball that radiates with prismatic colours that fall all over the hall. You can see an arch that leads to central tower.</Description>

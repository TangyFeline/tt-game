<Description>A dirt road runs past the southern end of St. Circe's athletic field. As if goes westward, the pathway is known as the 'walk of shame' to those in local fraternities, as many a young man has walked it alone in the early morning, after spending an eventful night at the sorority house to the west, or Make-Out Point to the south. The road also continues eastward, off towards Main Street, by way of the Sunnyglade Pool.</Description>

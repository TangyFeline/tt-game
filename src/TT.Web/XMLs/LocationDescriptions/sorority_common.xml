<Description>You are now standing in the common area of the Sorority House. You can tell from appearances that this is one of the most well-travelled rooms in the house, as there are comfy couches and sofas against the wall. The walls are tastefully decorated with pictures of some of the more notable alumnae of the sorority, including the house mother. In fact, as you enter the room you see two sisters sitting on a couch talking about their plans for the upcoming weekend, they look at you and wait for you to leave before they continue their conversation.</Description>

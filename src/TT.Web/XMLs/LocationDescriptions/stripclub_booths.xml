<Description>You are in the Treasure Chest, a strip club.  You are in a narrow hallway with eight small rooms off to the sides, private booths for lapdances and 'special' interactions between the employees and the customers.  Legally these booths are supposed to be hands-free, but based on a few lost articles of undergarments and packages of condoms, you suspect a little more happens every now and then. </Description>

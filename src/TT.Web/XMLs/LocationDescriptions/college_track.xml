<Description>You are standing in the athletics field of the small Saint Circe's Community College.  It is more or less a single field combined for soccer, football, and rugby, all surrounded by a kilometer long rubber-topped track.  Bottles of water and energy drinks overflow from trash bins and the field itself looks in need of replacement turf due to heavy use but minimal funding.</Description>

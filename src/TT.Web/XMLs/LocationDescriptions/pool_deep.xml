<Description>You are in the Sunnyglade Public Pool.  You are at the deep swimming area, a separate area where the water ranges from eight to fourteen feet deep.  Two diving boards dip over one side, a short one only a few feet above the water and a tall one twenty feet higher.  There appears to be a pair of swimming trunks stuck in a drain way down at the bottom of the pool--you must have missed a good show some time earlier as some poor guy had to explain why he couldn't get out of the water, not without someone bringing him a towel first...</Description>

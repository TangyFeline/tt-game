<Description>You are at the Sunnyglade Public Pool.  You are by the shallow swimming area meant for parents to watch their children splash around in shallow safety while they rest on flimsy metal propped-up cots.  A giant plastic mushroom with water streaming out of the top, running down all sides thunders into the water below.  There don't seem to be any families here at the moment.  Probably for the best.</Description>

<Description>You are in the central tower of Valentine's Castle.  You are standing on a glorious spiraling stairway covered with red-velvet carpet. Ornate doors lead to different rooms of the castle.  From this high tower you can see whole town--it must be powerful magic that prevented you from seeing the castle back in town.  From your vantage point you can notice some familiar places like Saint Circe's and, further down the road, the Smelly Sorceress Tavern. </Description>

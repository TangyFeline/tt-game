  <Description>The tree in the center is absolutely massive. It also looks very old. It must have stood here for a long time. There is an entrance that leads inside, guarded by fairies who inspect you for a moment before they let you in. The entrance is fairly small but it’s big enough for you to fit through. This must be where the great fairies reside. They are much bigger than their lesser sisters after all. The hall you enter is huge and you can even stand upright in here. The walls here are decorated with large tapestries all depicting something. These must all have been important happenings in the history of the grove. For instance, one of them seems to depict an earthquake wreaking havoc on the grove but one fae is depicted at the top as if a hero. A large door sits opposite the entrance and two more fairies are guarding it. You ask what’s inside and they tell you that this is where the high fairy council meets.</Description>

<Description>You are in the abandoned Erie Estate.  You are in the study, a cozy room with a large writing desk and fireplace, bookshelves surrounding every inch of the walls except an east-facing window overlooking the yard.  You pick up a dusty paper from the desk and blow off the grime, trying to make sense of the chicken-scratch writing on the paper.  Something to do with... financial concerns... unpaid interest... regrettable measures... missing servants and gardenkeepers...  The bottom half of the letter is burnt away from discarded cigar butts and an old coffee spill.</Description>

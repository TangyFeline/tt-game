<Description>You are in the Abandoned Erie Estate.  You are in the master bedroom, a finely furnished room boasting a giant canopy bed.  Thin sheets surround the mattress, bobbing and weaving in the gentle breeze that drifts through the mansion.  You take a deep breath and pull the curtains aside, half expecting to find a pair of skeletons on the bed or something equally creepy and clich√©, but all you discover is some nasty water damage and a mouldy smell.</Description>

<Description>You are in the audience area of the Oldport Concert Hall,  a large empty area facing the stage that could hold maybe one or two hundred spectators.  The floor is dusty and littered with trampled fliers, cigarettes, an even the odd pair of discarded (regular, non-human) panties or thongs.  A bunch of fold up chairs are stacked against a wall for calmer events.</Description>

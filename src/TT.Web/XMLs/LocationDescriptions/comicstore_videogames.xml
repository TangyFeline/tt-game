<Description>You are in the Extended Universe Comic Book Store.  You are standing in a room filled with shelves of board and video games, at least half of them used.  There don't seem to be many newer titles on the shelves, and some of the consoles the games run you vaguely recall were discontinued a very long time ago.  There's certainly a heavy feeling of nostalgia here.</Description>

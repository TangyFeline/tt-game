<Description>South of this section of wooded road is the entrance to the Sapphire Lake National Reserve - home of spectacular natural beauty. Not to mention rumors of it being the make-out capital of the region, along with several more disturbing urban legends. The road continues west towards the St. Circe's campus, and east towards Main Street.</Description>

<Description>You are at the hot springs deep inside the Scarlet Forest.  A lost wandered might never discover the hot water gurgling out from underneath some boulders and gathering in a crystal clear pool off it weren't for the occasional hiss as a gust of steam erupts out Like an ancient dragon waking from a long sleep ready to burst out of the soils burying it.  As unlikely as that scenario is, after all you have seen in your life you don't necessary dismiss the possibility of it being literally true.  For now you tiptoe cautiously around anywhere the ground glistens with settled most so as to avoid being scalded by the earth.</Description>

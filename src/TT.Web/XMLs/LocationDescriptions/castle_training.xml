<Description>
You are in the Training Halls in the Valentine castle.  The room you just entered is oddly spacious compared to the others in this part of the Castle. It is circular in nature and appears to be mostly empty at first sight, like some kind of arena. Another door on the opposite site leads you to another room. It resembles armory on the other side of the Castle, but equipment here is completely different as well as the room itself -it looks more comfortable. Few armchairs as well as many bookshelves filled with ancient tomes that are filled with various techniques of combat. Combined with the first rooms spacious design it appears to be some sort of training facility.</Description>

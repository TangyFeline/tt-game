<span class='booktitle'>An Exploration of Fae Volume 2:  the Elders Clan</span><br><br>

<span class='bookauthor'>By Nigel Pricklegrape</span><br><br>

The Elders are a much older family than the Winston clan and differ greatly in their interactions, philosophies, and sources of magicks.  Far less is known on the origin of the Elders.  What I can confidently say is that the oldest among them is well over a hundred a fifty thousand years old whereas Jewdewfae, one of the youngest of her clan, is approximately a hundred and two thousand years of age, give or take a few centuries.  The Elders take little notice of the lessor passings of time and are sometimes surprised to discover that a tiny sapling they planted had already grown to be a millennia old before ultimately succumbing to fire or drought, falling down and rotting away to permit a new generation of trees to reach toward the sun.</br></br>

Unlike the Winstons, the Elders have no one home, no grove to which they are bound, no flower from which they are born and reborn.  Although their origins can be traced back to Ireland where they were birthed into existence from the strange and ancient ley lines that converge near ancient stone monuments, the Elders are naturally nomadic.  These restless fae spend no more than a few years in a nest before moving on to find new home, whether their destination lies a mile away or a thousand.  I do not know the precise reason for this, but I speculate that the Elders draw magic from the nature surrounding them, from the water, trees, rocks, sun, air, even the beasts that walk on four legs on the ground or sail through the air on wings.  Staying in any one location for too long risks exhausting the ambient magical energies that make their living possible, or so I am led to deduce.</br></br>

As with the Winston clan, the Elders view themselves as caretakers of the natural world and all its fauna and flora, killing not so much as an ant in the span of a (very long) lifetime.  The Elders are as such true pacifists (though to say so is misleading, since while the Elders may never shed a drop of blood against the living, they have no such qualms about transforming intruders into trees and statues until the end of time, as I shall have more to say about later!)</br></br>

The Elders present themselves as young women, typically about nine inches tall with translucent wings and glowing faintly with pale blue runic tattoos.  It is not technically correct to say that the Elders are female.  As with the Winstons, the Elders do not produce offspring with their own kind.  However, since every Elder is a born shapeshifter, it is possible for an Elder to adopt a male form and pass on their genes to a compatible non-fae, though this has only happened several times in the Elder's long history to my knowledge, and I cannot imagine the sisters took kindly to this!</br></br>

When it comes to governance, there is essentially no social structure amongst the Elders, no distinction between greater fairy or lessor, no mother-daughter lineages or central matriarch to guide the clan.  Each fae is her own being of equal power and rank, addressing one another respectfully by "sister".  The Elder clan is run loosely as a democracy--or perhaps, dare I say, an anarchy!  How can they organize their migrations to a new nest, you might ask!  As strange as it may seem to us humans, the Elder fae have little problem with such.  When a majority of the clan decides a new nesting ground is in order, the rest of the family typically agree and move as one.  No fae holds claim to any property or personal belongings for long, though minor petty squabbling is common as any sisters are bound to do.</br></br>

While there have been some short-lived peaceful schisms when the clan separated into multiple smaller nests--not to mention a few hermits who thought it might be restful to take a long nap as an oak tree or hill for a few hundred to thousand years--the Elders have always come back together again.  In the occasion that an Elder misbehaves or offends a fellow sister, the others use social ostracism instead of violence, shunning the wrongdoer for some years until the issue is addressed with a proper apology or the act forgotten and forgiven as a meaningless transgressions from the past.</br></br>

It should not surprise my readers that the Elders have never taken a likening to humanity, despising our destructive tendencies to force the land to adapt to us instead of living in harmony with it.  At first humans were a rarity and could be safely ignored, just another somewhat intelligent species to keep an eye on and wait for either our extinction or migration away. .  However, humankind began to not only survive but proceeded to thrive, reaching all ends of the earth and felling entire forests to farms, blasting mountains and draining lakes.  It finally became clear to the Elders that humanity posed some threat to their way of life. For hundreds of our generations any Elder who spotted a human would immediately transform them into a tree, stone, flower, rabbit, deer, or some other suitable form of wildlife.  Else they might embed their victim's spirit with that of a local natural landmark, binding their soul to the land for an eternity. Who amongst you have not heard of some tale of a Lady of the Lake, Weeping Willow, or Will-o-the-Wisp, heard the whispering of pines in a gentle breeze?</br></br>

However, no matter how many humans they transformed and wove back into nature, humans kept on breeding children who followed in their ancestors' footsteps in greater and greater number.  Our urge to explore and adventure kept generation after generation of explorers and settlers penetrating deeper into the Elders' lands, quickly forgetting those lost to the fae's retaliation.  Finally realizing that their efforts would ultimately be in vain, the Elders adopted a new policy to simply hide as best they could, casting spells only on those who wandered too close to their current nesting grounds by curiosity or chance.  As farms sprung into villages, villages to towns, and towns to cities, the Elders kept retreating into isolation, eventually leaving their rainy island home to seek solace on the great lands to the west.  There they found the peace they craved for some time thousand years.  But of course not even that was to last.</br></br>

Stories are all well and good, but what if you should chance to meet an Elder yourself?  If you ever see an Elder fae, I regret to inform you that you likely do not have long to run and hide.</br></br>

While most Elders would rather hide out of sight until clumsy humans have finished passing by some of the crueler Elders have found some measure of vengeance and have become devious tricksters, shattering their own policies of isolation and nonintervention to cast spells upon some unsuspecting victims.  In one notorious legend, three fae came upon a village and changed each and every inhabitant into marble statues.  A year later visitors came by to trade only to find dozens of petrified men and women frozen in shocked (and some oddly lustfully ecstatic!) stances and expressions.  There are many variations on this in which instead of statues visitors find a pack of deer still wearing their peasant garb, or instead of deer bleating sheep or whinnying ponies.  Some may be dismissed as legend, but I would not discount these stories possessing strange truths.</br></br>

Should you stumble across a ring of naked stone women locked dancing or making love in a remote corner of the woods, count your blessings and hope the Elders have already moved on, and perhaps whisper some kind words into the poor souls' ears.  Should you see a tree with the strange contours of a man or woman, chances are not slim that they used to walk the earth on two legs as you or I do.  And if you fall victim yourself, be aware that the Elders have little interest in ever restoring you to your form self again.</br></br>

If I have provided a frightening vision of the Elders, know I do so only for your own safety!  But not all that can be said of this ancient and noble clan is for the ill!</br></br>

While the Elders do harbor bitterness toward humankind, it is not entirely unheard of to see some of the younger Elders fae make peaceful contact with "the Biggies."  Most often these adventurous fae youths venture into Sunnyglade or nearby towns to cause mischief, using their magic to prank innocent passers-by for no reason other than some laughs.  Most often these pranks are harmless enough, swapping minds of genders of lovers in the middle of their passions, shrinking a pedestrian down to an inch or two tall, blowing you up like a balloon and making you cling on to a friend or tree before you float up into the sky!  These transformation usually last for no longer than a day or week at most.</br></br>

If you put on a good show and provide your watchers enough giggles, you may find yourself visited again and again with all new manners of mischief, so if you wish to avoid future encounters your best chance is to pretend nothing is wrong and keep your calm.  Bore your bullies away.  With their desire for fun and chaos fulfilled, or some other poor Biggie providing a more entertaining subject to harass with their magic, you ought to resume life with only a few embarrassing stories, something you and the pals to laugh about over drinks in a year or two.  I've even spoken to a chap or two who say they've rather come to enjoy these little surprises… perhaps even addicted to their magic, which is often said to fill its target with great ecstasy  and arousal as their bodies change.</br></br>

Yet even among these few playful fae, only one has ever truly befriended humans, the youth named Jewdewfae.  She boasts of having been the first of her clan to meet a Biggie.  Oh, of the countless hours I have spent with her, exchanging games and my own intimacy to bargain for a coherent story of her elusive clan!  She bores easily and forgets her commitments, teasing me for spending so many years of my life with a pen in my hand!  She tells me that in the past hundred years she has spent far more time amongst mankind than her own sisters, leading her to be perpetually ostracized by even the most open-minded of her sisters.  And though she is as mischievous as any other youths,  Jewdewfae is also unique in that she, with her kind heart, do all she can to restore the less fortunate victims of her sisters back to their human form, or failing that, the closest humanoid approximations.  The more literary minded among you may recall that Jewdewfae has a hand in terms founding Sunnyglade itself.</br></br>

And such concludes what little I can share of the clan known as the Elders.

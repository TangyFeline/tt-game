<h3>Clothing and Apparel</h3>

<b><i>There’s no excuse for a Fashion Witch to run out of clothing!  These fun little spells will ensure you always have something--or rather, someone--to wear!</i></b>

</br></br>

<b>”Just a moment, let me get dressed.”</b>  This is a perfect time to change the target into, you guessed it, a dress.  5 points!  <i>Variations:  “Go get dressed!”  “”</i>

</br></br>

<b>”I asked my boyfriend when we were going to get married, but he just kept on skirting around the issue.”</b>  Clearly your boyfriend is better suited wrapped around your hips than as a man.  10 points!

</br></br>

<b>”My boyfriend sure gave me a headache at first, but I eventually brought him to heel.”</b>  Enjoy your new pair of stilettos.  10 points!  <i>Variations:  “My boyfriend has such a great sole!”  “Go away!  Shoe!”</i>

</br></br>

<b>”Excuse me sir, could you give me the time?”</b>  Watches are expensive, so good job, you just saved yourself a few bucks.  7 points!  <i>Variations:  “I’ve been watching you...”  “NOW I know what makes you tick!”  “He just clocked out.”</i>

</br></br>

<b>”It took a little magic but now my boyfriend is so incredibly supportive!”</b>  Your days of trying on bras in crowded department stores are now over.  12 points!  <i>Variations:  “Don’t worry, I’ll always keep you close to my heart.”  “Now you’re pulling some weight in our relationship, aren’t you?”  “He’s totally hooked on me.”</i>

<b>”I just cleared your schedule.  You looked a little too tied up.”</b>  I didn’t forget about you, gentlemen!  A nice shirt is nothing with a tie..  15 points!

</br></br>

<b>”Why yes, you suit me just fine!”</b>  Another one for the gents; nothing says confidence like a nice jacket.  8 points!  <i>Variations:  “You’re suited perfectly for the position.”</i>

</br></br>

<b>”He was always trying so hard to get into my pants… and now he is! ”</b>  People make the best panties.  Unfortunately this one’s pretty easy, so only 3 points.

</br></br>

<b>”The thief tried to pay for everything he stole.  Unfortunately he came up a little short.”</b>  Who likes short shorts?  We like short shorts!  5 points!

</br></br>

<b>”Don’t worry, it’s safe.  Nothing gets past him.”</b>  Always wear your rubbers!  7 points!

<h3>Household Furniture and Belongings</h3>

<b><i>There’s only so much space for you to wear clothes and to absorb people, so these spells will let you keep them around the house.</i></b>

</br></br>

<b>”No, you can’t talk to my sister right now.  She’s too stoned right now.”</b>  Learning how to sculpt is a long process so just find a “volunteer” for that statue out in the garden.  4 points!  <i>Variations:  “My relationship with her is a little… rocky right now.”</i>

</br></br>

<b>”I walked in on my husband spooning with his mistress.  Oh, they’re still doing it now next to the forks and knives.”</b> Only downside to this is you’ll have to find a lot of people if you want a matching set.  6 points!

</br></br>

<b>”My boyfriend didn’t appreciate the spell I cast on him last night.  He’s still shaking a little.”</b>  We all know that the vibrator is a girl’s REAL best friend.  12 points!  

</br></br>

<b>”My wife is pursuing a change in her career.  In fact you could say she’s sort of branching out.”</b> Good, no need to break your back digging a hole for that tree you want out by the porch.  10 points!  <i>Variations:  “You could say that my stepbrother is… turning a new leaf.”</i>

</br></br>

<b>”It’s not like that chick is my biggest fan.  But she does keep me really cool in the summer.”</b> Don’t forget to have fun doing that voice chopping thing that makes you sound like a robot.  5 points!

</br></br>

<b>”I’ve decided to spice up our life.”</b> Good pepper grinders are hard to find. 10 points!  <i>Variations:  “You’re grounded, young man!”  “Back to the daily grind?””</i>

</br></br>

<b>”You’re so clingy.  Keep it that way.”</b> That plastic wrap always seems to go away faster than it should, doesn’t it?  12 points!

<h3>Absorption</h3>

<b><i>Clothing can get lost or torn, your house broken into and your belongings stolen.  The best way to make sure you keep who you transform is to absorb them right into your own body!</i></b>

</br></br>

<b>”You got a little under my skin tonight, dear.  I’m going to keep you there.”</b> Only two points since this is very generic. 

</br></br>

<b>”How did my date go?  It was totally a bust.  Now so is he!”</b>  Easiest way to go up a cup or two is to add that special guy or gal to it.  10 points!

</br></br>

<b>”Got milk?  Of course you do...”</b>  For the expecting mammas out there!  15 points!

</br></br>

<b>”You’re such a dick!”</b>  The only way to grow a couple of inches that actually works, online spam enhancement pills be damned.. 6 points!

</br></br>

<b>”James was always more of an ass man.  Now he’s just an ass… mine!.”</b> Who can complain about a gal with some extra junk in the trunk?  7 points!

<hr>

<h3>Food</h3>

<b><i>Generally it’s considered very poor manners to eat someone you’ve turned into food no matter how delicious they look, but if you must be sure to leave a few crumbs, just enough to keep track of so you can change them back someday if for some crazy reason you want to.</i></b>

</br></br>

<b>”Can you make me a sandwich?”</b> This classic needs no explanation.  3 points.  <i>Variations:  “I see you’re in a bit of a pickle” (turn them into a cucumber.)  ”You’re spread a little thing right now.”  (turn them into butter.)</i>

</br></br>

<b>”My boyfriend is just such a sucker for my magic.”</b> Nothing like a good old fashioned lollipop.  4 points!

</br></br>

<b>”You’re such a brat!”</b> Or is it Italian Sausage?  Bahama Mama?  3 points.

</br></br>

<b>”Don’t worry, everything is going just… peachy.”</b> What else is there to say?  3 points.

</br></br>

<b>”All you do is whine whine whine… so turning you into cabernet sauvignon isn’t really that much of a change for you now, is it, dear?”</b> Personal favorite of mine!  Goes well with “Say cheese!” and “You’re always loafing around.”  10 points.</i>

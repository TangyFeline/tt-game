    <p>Human Resource Furniture(TM) proudly pairs people desiring a temporary placement as a piece of furniture with eager owners for a price.  These enchanted household belongings are highly in demand as the rare and powerful spells that transform them also allow them to return various gifts and magics to their new owners. </p>

    <p>Your covenant has <span title="Arpeyjis" class="icon icon-money"></span><b>@ViewBag.CovenantMoney</b> Arpeyjis available to spend.  Your covenant is able to hold at most <b>@ViewBag.FurnitureLimit</b> pieces of furniture in your safeground.  Upgrade your safeground to be able to keep more at once.</p>

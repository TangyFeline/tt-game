<p>As you walk into the pool room at the Smelly Sorceress Tavern, your eyes slowly adjusting to the hazy darkness, you spot two pairs of eyes starting at your from the opposite wall, reflecting the light from the other room faintly.  Your heart skips a beat but you pretend not to notice, going about your routine while keeping your attention focused on the pair of potential attackers.  Who knows, maybe you could even catch THEM by surprise... </p>

<p>'Are you ready, master?  We could rob this blind fool in seconds.' You hear a faint hiss from the shadowy figures, a trebel male voice with a bit of a lisp.</p>

<p>'Patient, apprentice.  This 'fool' knows we're here already and wants to lull us into a false sense of security.  Can't you smell their sweat?  Dead give away," replies a female voice.  You detect an upper class accent, just the manner of her tone suggesting a familiarity with high manners.</p>

<p>'Fine, fine.  We spare this one.  For now.'  The two figures step out into the light, a male and female anthro rat thief couple.  They both wear dark green cloaks and carry a sack of heavy-looking loot but are otherwise fully naked.  'Piss off, mage!' the male one snarls, 'or else learn what it means to be stalked by the Seekshadows guild!'</p>

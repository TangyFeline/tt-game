<p>The rumors of a demon have led you toward the Scarlet Forest. Tales of a trickster running about and turning people into rather festive things was enough for you to poke about. You're sure others have heard about the stories, but you know you'll be the first to run across them and show them how a professional deals with things.</p>

<p>As you move deeper into the woods, you find your way pushing through an unnerving amount of evergeeen trees. While not entirely abnormal to run across in a place like this, these are decorated with an assortable of colorful ornaments. Each seems to give off a rather eerie jingle in the otherwise silent location. Have you come across some kind of odd joke, hidden so far from town?</p>

<p>The sound of rustling foliage from behind you catches your attention and you cautiously turn to face the noise. You find yourself face-to-face with another tree. You squint past the branches and are gripped by dread as your eyes fall upon a humanoid face shaped into the bark. Over and over again, its wooden lips seem to move weakly as if mouthling 'Help me.' Panic sets in and you do a complete 180, only to bump into a tall and menacing woman. Her presence seems to grip your very heart with sadness and despair.</p>

<p>Shaking in fright, you look up to stare into her glowing face. Goat horns curve out from her forehead and your eyes are freeted by something dangling in her hand above the two of you. Mistletoe.</p>

<p>"Naughty, naughty," she scolds you as her arm wraps around you as she attempts to pull you in for a kiss. You do the quickest thing you can without thinking and immediately bolt in the opposite direction away from her. As you flee in terror toward the direction you came, you can hear her cackling behind you. "I'll be waiting for you!" she shouts at you before she disappears deeper into the forest.</p>

<p>You hear it off in the distance.  A rumble, like thunder off in the mountains.  But as it draws closer and louder, you hear that it is not just one rumble but many, the whine of dozens of motors approaching.  You peer down the road just in time to see it begin to flood with crimson dots--motorcycles!  You dash to the side of the road as the gang approaches, riding in a diamond formation, a single woman at the front approaching with a scowl with dozens more ladies mounted on crimson bikes behind her.</p>

<p>“You there!”</p>

<p>You freeze in place as the leader rides up to you, coasting to a stop just before running over your foot.</p>

<p>“What is this town?” she asks.</p>

<p>“Sunnyglade,” you reply.  “Who are you?”</p>

<p>The woman laughs.  “Some call me the Bitch of Wheels.  Others call me the Gasoline She-Devil.  But I am a fair and just ruler to my followers, so you may call me the Queen.  Harley the Road Queen.”</p>

<p>The women behind her all rev their engines in salute to their leader, eyeing you and the others gathering to see with looks of contempt on their faces.</p>

<p>“This ‘Sunnyglade’ is ours now,” Queen Harley calls out, riding in circles, weaving expertly in and out of the crowd, on and off the road.  “I demand a tribute!  Send forth your finest riders and they may join us as a Road Recruit.  And as for the rest…”  In the blink of an eye she casts a spell at a bystander and before he has any chance to react, he falls forward, transformed into a brand new shiny crimson motorcycle, the same make as the rest of the gang.  Harley runs her hand over his seat, caressing it gently like a lover.  “You will help us out in our conquest of the roads, one way or another.  Recruits!  On me!”</p>

<p>She rides off down the road, the gang following close behind.  A few bolts of magic zip out from their formation as they drive off, striking a few more unfortunate targets who fall to the ground as tires, dildos, panties, and red cases of gasoline.  You’d better keep an eye out...</p>

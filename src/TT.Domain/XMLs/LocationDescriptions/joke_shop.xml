  <Description>Some people say this place doesn't exist, and yet here you are, in among the prank-filled antique shelves of Sunnyglade's fabled Joke Shop.  You've heard this rickety Olde Worlde store used to be a permanent fixture in town, but one day it just vanished.  Stories tell of an overconfident mage miscasting a great spell and ripping the shop from reality, leaving it steeped in magic and floating between realms.  It is said the tormented apparitions of the people who were in the shop still haunt it to this day, making mischief for anybody who finds their way here.  You get an uneasy sense that this is not a safe place.  Perhaps you should leave before you catch somebody's attention?</Description>

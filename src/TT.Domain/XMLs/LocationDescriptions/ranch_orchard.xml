  <Description>You are at the Milton Ranch, a famous... or infamous... local landmark you've heard about from whispers and rumors.  While the orchard appears to be well-maintained, there also seems to be an uncontrolled wildness to it.  Fruit-bearing trees of different varieties are lined in planned rows and straight lines, yet their limbs seem chaotic and unkempt as if reaching out for help.  When a bounty of fresh fruits is available, each is unnaturally plump and engorged, a treat to be had.</Description>

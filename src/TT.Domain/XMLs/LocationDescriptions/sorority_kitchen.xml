<Description>You are standing in the sorority house's kitchen. At first glance, this room seems to be a typical kitchen, there's a refrigerator, a pantry, a stove and oven, and a wine rack. However, a cursory glance through the cupboards and refrigerator would indicate that these girls have an appetite of a more alcoholic nature. All of the liquor you see in the cabinets is top shelf, and the fridge is fully stocked with beer for the frat boys who will inevitably come to spend the night. </Description>

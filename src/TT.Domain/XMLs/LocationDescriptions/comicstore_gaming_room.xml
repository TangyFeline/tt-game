<Description>You are in the Extended Universe Comic Book Store.  You are in a side room that is mostly empty except for a few long plastic tables set up with a few dozen chairs surrounding them, intended for scheduled group games, tournaments, and events.  There are shelves along the walls, chaotically filled with game board boxes of all themes, shapes, and color, and not a one looks as though it has fewer than half a dozen pieces missing from heavy use over the years.  A waste bin in the corder overflows with empty soda cans.</Description>

<Description>You are standing inside a mid-sized clothing store named Ophalia's Embroidery.  You are in the back corner of the store, surrounded by sexy, lacy lingerie and corsets meant for more intimate encounters.  Interestingly, each piece is distinct from the rest, no corporate logos or branding on any of them.  You get the feeling that you're being watched by an entire audience, waiting to see what you do... who you pick out to take home...</Description>

  <Description>A vast expanse of concrete stretches out as far as the eyes can see. In the summer, the heat is sure to reflect off its surface and possibly bake a brain or two! Otherwise, this area is rather featureless other than markings for spots to park vehicles and the occasional street lamp surrounded by concrete foundation.</Description>

<Description>You are in the Lord's Room of Valentine's Castle.  A big red covered bed is the centre of the room. You can somehow feel that someone really important lived here. A crystal chandelier hangs over your head, shining dimly in the limited light.  To the back is an entrance to small balcony occupied by two massive stone gargoyle statues.  Interestingly, they are made from a white marble instead of black one.</Description>

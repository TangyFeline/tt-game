<Description>While the scenery around Sapphire Lake is beautiful and the campgrounds well maintained, business has been bad lately; nearly everyone in town knows what happened there last summer. Or at least they think they do, though in truth the stories they tell vary wildly. All agree that 12 young college students camped here for a week last July, and that *something* happened. Some simply state they were never seen again, though others tell wild stories. Some only that the young men among them were changed into women. Others that all 12 became identical-looking over-sexed bimbos. Others still that the each member of the group was turned into a different animal. A few wild tales even suggest that the young campers now adorn the clothes racks over at Ophelia's. Most tales mention some kind of inhuman culprit - and while you're sure that a local renegade mage is a much more likely suspect than some sort of monster, the presence of some stones piled up in what could pass as an altar, near flat ground stained with a dried red fluid does give you pause...</Description>

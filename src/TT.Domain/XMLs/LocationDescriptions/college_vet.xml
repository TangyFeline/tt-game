<Description>You are standing in the strangely-specific veterinarian center of the small Saint Circe's Community College.  The room is filled with cages, all clean and well looked after, but there don't seem to be any animals inside.  Posters of various feline, canine, and even equine anatomy line the walls, along with a strangely familiar looking woman with the name 'Saint Circine' below.  Her gaze gives you the creeps.</Description>

<Description>You are at the Milton Ranch, a famous... or rather, an infamous local landmark you've heard about from whispers and rumors.  You are standing in a grassy pasture behind the ranch, a place where the animals are let out every now and then to graze and roam.  Despite heavy grazing, the grass seems as green—no, greener—than surrounding lots.  Is magic at play?  If this ranch lives up to its legends, undoubtedly there's some mystical force at work here.</Description>

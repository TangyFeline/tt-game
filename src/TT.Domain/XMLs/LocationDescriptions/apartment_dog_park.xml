<Description>You are in the dog park at the Oldoak Apartment Complex.  It isn't much more than a lot of grass where dog owners can let their pets run around on a leash and get some much-needed exercise after being cooped up in a small room all day.  You narrowly avoid a pile of dog droppings and begin to watch your step a little more closely.</Description>

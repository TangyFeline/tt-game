<Description>You are in the baths of Valentine's Castle.  Everything in here is made of same pitch-black marble that you've seen all over the castle. A fragrance of roses is in the air. You can see a bathtub and a pool that is embedded in the floor. Overall, it seems like this is a really fun place to be, especially when you notice all the candles and some... other things.</Description>

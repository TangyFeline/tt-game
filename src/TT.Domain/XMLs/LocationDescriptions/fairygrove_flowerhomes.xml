  <Description>When the fairies notice you’re stepping towards the beautiful flowers, most of them instantly fly over to you. “Wait!” “Stop!” “Be careful!” they all shout at you. Curious, you wonder what’s wrong. You just wanted to take a look at the flowers after all! They looked so gorgeous from a distance. That’s when you see one of the flowers open up and a fae comes out who instantly joins her fairy sisters. You realize what these flowers are to the fae and they instantly confirm your suspicions. “These are our homes! Be careful!” they chant. You do your best to calm them all down, which takes about 10 minutes until they are certain you are not a threat. Finally you get to admire the flowers! They are quite big, obviously so that they can house fairies. There are roses, tulips, irises, even flowers you’ve never even seen before!</Description>

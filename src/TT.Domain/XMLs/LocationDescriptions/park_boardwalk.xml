<Description>You are in the peaceful Sunnyglade City Park.  You are on an old wooden boardwalk that runs a short loop through a more heavily forested and swampy area of the park.  Frogs croak nearby but as you walk closer you hear splashes as they leap into the water, invisible to your sense of sight until you see the splash.</Description>

<Description>You are in the peaceful Sunnyglade City Park.  You are on a small, weed-choked dirt path that was roped off a while ago until trespassers knocked the ropes down.  There is a small ring of stones amongst a cove of trees with some melted candles and strange symbols on them, sort of like some kind of shrine.</Description>

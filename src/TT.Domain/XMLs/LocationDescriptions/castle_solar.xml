<Description>You are in the solar room of Valentine's Castle. These are the private quarters used by the Lord's family. Favoured by the family's members, it was used not only as bedroom but also as sitting room.  Only few were permitted to enter here.  Some of maids seem to have been blessed with that privilege, based on some maid's garments folded neatly on a table.  You wonder what might have happened to maids who entered without permission--and how much longer they stayed human.</Description>

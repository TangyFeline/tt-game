<Description>You are in the back, private room of a local pub named the Smelly Sorceress sitting on the corner of 14 and Main.  The room is meant to host private parties and is a bit fancier than the rest, relatively new carpets and a shelf full of exclusive liquors.  Despite a public smoking ban you can smell the combined must of a thousand cigarettes.</Description>

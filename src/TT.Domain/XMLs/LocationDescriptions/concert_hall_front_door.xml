<Description>You are at the front door of the Oldport Concert Hall.  There are two large wooden double doors here, painted black and covered with old rusted staples that once held up various posters and fliers over the many years the building stood.  Being a multi-purpose concert hall, all manner of rock concerts, plays, poetry readings, and all manner of other performances are displayed on the layers of advertisements still stapled or pinned to the walls.</Description>

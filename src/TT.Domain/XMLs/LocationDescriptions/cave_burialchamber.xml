<Description>You are in a chamber inside the Silent Caverns.  You had to hike what felt like hours to reach the end of the tunnel that brought you here, and now that you have arrived you aren't sure if you want to linger here for long.  The chamber seems to be a burial ground of some sort, inhabited by native peoples centuries, maybe millenia ago.  Arrowheads and flint tools rest atop a stone boulder with its top smoothed off to create a sort of worktable.  The cavern walls here are cool but dry, decorated with patterns and symbols of a long lost culture.  But most interesting--not to mention disturbing--are the bones tucked into niches in the rocks, a combination of human and animal, ceremonially laid out with the utmost respect.  You don't dare disturb their slumber.</Description>

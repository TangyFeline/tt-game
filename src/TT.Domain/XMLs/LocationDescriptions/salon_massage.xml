<Description>You are inside the Blazes and Glamour Beauty Spa inside a clean room with white walls and a fuzzy white carpet, mostly empty except for three raised tables with white towels draped on top where masseurs ease the muscles of customers with soft, warm fingers.  A few potted plants line the walls, ferns and bright tropical flowers that give the impression of some kind of Asian country without being specific as to which ones.  Everything here is clean and white, very tranquil and zen-like.</Description>

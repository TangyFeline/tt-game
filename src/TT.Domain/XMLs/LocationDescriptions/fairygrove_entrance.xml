<Description>You are in the Winston Grove at the entrance.  At first glance, all you can see is a bunch of trees bundled up together. Nothing much to see here. When you decide to go through the trees however, that is when you find out that the trees are actually hiding the infamous Winston fairy grove you’ve been hearing about. You find a massive tree standing in the middle dotted with countless flowers of all shapes and colours. You can see a little pond to your right and there’s even more flowers to your left. More importantly though, the entire place is simply littered with little lights floating about. Obviously these must be fae! The moment you step into the grove, all of the fae suddenly stop and they all look at you, curious as to what you’re going to do. They must be quite shy around strangers.</Description>

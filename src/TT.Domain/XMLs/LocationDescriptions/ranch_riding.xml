  <Description>You are at the Milton Ranch, a famous... or infamous... local landmark you've heard about from whispers and rumors.  What ranch wouldn't be complete without some manner of training area for horses and show ponies?  A nicely-kept track circles around the borders of this field, with training equipment littered about its outskirts.  Various training regiments can be praticed in this area, and one is sure to turn an eye with enough hard work!</Description>

<Description>You are standing in the front yard of the Eta Gamma Mu sorority, the oldest and most prestigious Greek organization at St. Circe. You are impressed by the perfectly manicured landscaping that compliments the sorority house. In the front yard is a plaque that reads the following: Established in 1948, the mission of Eta Gamma Mu is to assist young ladies become proper young women through hard work, dedication and discipline. Throughout campus, the word is that all the prettiest girls attend this sorority, and that the most raucous socials on campus happen here too. The chapter has certainly earned it's nickname of Everyone's Gone Mad - you can't help but think of other catchy acronyms that you might be able to call the sisters.</Description>

<Description>You are in Physician Room A in the Henryson Medical Clinic.  A swiveling, reclined metal chair with leather cushions sits in the center of the room, a worn wooden stool beside it.  Each wall is lined with white painted cupboards full of cotton pads, tissues, individually wrapped towels, various stainless steel probles, latex gloves, and all manners of medical paraphernalia.  The medicine cabinet is locked up tight, but the grass is partially broken off in a corner so it seems the honor system is and has been employed for a long time.  This room has plain white walls with a few posters showing various anatomical depictions of the human body as well as a few awards and diplomas for the clinic's practicing doctors and nurses.</Description>

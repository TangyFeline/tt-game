Well, okay, not everybody, but anybody who's anybody does.  According to you, anyway.  You are one of the more profitable business people out.  Not as successful as that computer guy (yet), but you're getting up there.  You are here for the money.  And only the money.  But if you happen to get one of your opponents under your thumb... well, with any luck, it'll be a bombshell who'll do whatever you so please, unlike those other girls who whine about their needs or whatever.  They must not like the handsome, charming, five foot eleven suited type.</blue>;[LoseDesc]               <pink>You've lost.  There are no other words for it.  You have lost, and you have lost bad.  You are still as intelligent as you were before you came here... you could back to your job, return to being a CEO, be on of the most power men... now woman... on the planet... but you won't.  You know you won't.  You don't want to.  There is another option now, one that is so pleasurable, so desirable, that you couldn't even imagine doing anything else.  You've been gifted with knowledge of a man... a master.  Your master.  You are still a CEO... but you don't want to be anything more then his slave now.  He looks out for you, make sure that you don't go too far in your quest for pleasure, and makes the most humiliating and helpless fantasies actually happen.  You slowly walk off the stage in a fog of arousal, inch by inch, teetering at a tiny 5' 2'' even on your 6'' heels through your hobble skirt, to his... to your masters house.  He promised to collar you if you surrendered yourself to him, and make sure you get gang raped by his friends.  Your bare pussy gushes at the thought... you love your new life, and will gladly give up your old one... even though you don't have to.</pink>;[Intel]               65;[Desire]               50;[Author]               Calypso;[AuthorHome]               null;[Tags]               mtf slave bondage bdsm;[SHOES];[STAGE] 0;[status]               Your shoes are custom ordered from Italy, just because you could.  They are a soft brown leather, with around half an inch on the heel. They are worth a couple hundred dollars, easily.;[short]               expensive italian leather shoes;[tgShade]            shoes 0;[STAGE] 1;[tf]               You take a step to readjust yourself, and you hear a slight squeak.  Not a 'leather' squeak, either.  You take a look down and discover that your expensive brown leather italian shoes... have become black latex.  Nothing else appears to have changed, fortunately, but you'll still have to see about replacing them.;[status]               Your expensive brown leather shoes have become a shiny, squeaky latex.  They still have the half inch heel, but what was expensive has become tacky.  You can occasionally hear them squeak when you move in certain ways.;[short]               shiny black latex shoes;[tgShade]            shoes 16;[STAGE] 2;[tf]               You nearly fall over when you feel your shoes suddenly gain about an inch of heels.  Your balance is wrecked for a moment, and you have to wave your $ARMS$ around to help balance your $LEGS$ balance back on your new heels.  You take a quick learn down, and see that not only do your shoes now have one and a half inch heels, they've also seemed to change styles, into something more feminine.  You hope that they don't get any worse before this is over...;[status]               Your black, latex shoes have now become black, latex heels!  They reach up around one and a half inches, and it's a bit difficult at times to balance your $LEGS$ on them.  They've also changed shape, losing most of their italian flavor, and more into... well, latex heels.;[short]               small black latex heels;[tgShade]            shoes 33;[WaitFor]           legs 1;[STAGE] 3;[tf]               You feel the heels on your shoes suddenly hick... and despite the loss of balance, you can't help but let loose a small breath in relief as your $FEET$ get the support they need.  And then some.  They double in height, reaching three inches... at least your feet aren't hurting anymore.;[status]               Your shoes are now, definitely, black latex heels.  Any class they used to have as brown italian leather is gone forever, the three inch shoes encasing your $FEET$.  If it wasn't for the fact that they give your feet the support they now need, you'd take them off.;[short]               three inch black latex heels;[tgShade]            shoes 50;[WaitFor]           feet 2;[WaitFor]           pants 2;[STAGE] 4;[tf]               Given how much your clothing has changed, how restricting and hard to move in them they are, you very nearly fall over when your shoes spike up another couple of inches.  Five inch latex heels... You can't help but squirm at the feeling, the knowledge of what you are wearing.;[status]               You are now wearing five full inches of latex heels.  Your $FEET$ crave they support they give, but even so, you're feeling a bit like you're walking on stilts while on these things... you feel like you're going to fall over.  Of course, you can't help but feel that makes them all the better.;[short]               sexy five inch latex heels;[tgShade]            shoes 66;[STAGE] 5;[tf]               You suddenly gain another inch of your lost height, but, oddly enough, your heels don't seem to have changed in the slightest... they're still at a comfortable five inches.  You look down and, carefully, move your $FEET$ around to get a better look at your shoes... and they have grown an inch!  All around!  You are wearing five inch latex high heels... with a one inch platform.  Platform heels.  Platform latex heels.  You have to clamp down on your mouth to prevent a moan...;[status]               Your five inch heels have gained another inch, but instead of it just being on the heel, it's for the entire shoe.  Your five inch heels have become six inch platform heels.  You feel dizzy just standing in them, like you're going to fall down at any moment... you bite down another moan.  Despite yourself, you can't help but lov these shoes.;[short]               six inch platform latex heels;[tgShade]            shoes 83;[STAGE] 6;[tf]               You hear the sound of a lock closing.  Slowly, trying to fight the grin off of your face, you look down to your shoes... and see that they are both attached to thick black bands above your ankles, thick black bands that you'd have to remove to remove your shoes, thick black bands with a lock on each of them.    Thick black bands that get wet from the juices from your $GROIN$ at seeing them.;[status]               Your six inch latex platform heels... are now locked into place.  As it is you practically feel like you're going to fall down, and now you couldn't remove these teetering heels even if you had to.  They are stuck on you, and you are stuck in them.  The thought is so delicious that you can feel your juices sliding down your $LEGS$ from your $GROIN$...;[short]               locked in six inch platform latex heels;[tgShade]            shoes 100;[WaitFor]           mind 5;[FACE];[STAGE] 0;[status]               Your face is nice and sharp, your features outlined in a paragon of masculinity.  Or so the people you pay tell you.  There's just a hint of stubble there, enough to make you more attractive and 'down to earth' seeming... not that you really need it, of course.;[short]               perfectly male face;[tgShade]            face 0;[STAGE] 1;[tf]               You hear something similar to a 'poof', and suddenly you are stubble free.  All of it just fell out onto the floor... and your clothes.  With a grumble of annoyance you brush the stubble off your $SHIRT$ and $PANTS$, before feeling your face with your $HANDS$.  Yup... smooth as a baby's behind.  A minor annoyance at most.;[status]               Your face is nice and sharp, your features outlined in a paragon of masculinity.  Or so the people you pay tell you.  Unfortunately, all of your carefully measured stubble has fallen off, so it looks a bit less 'male' then you'd like.;[short]               perfectly smooth male face;[tgShade]            face 20;[STAGE] 2;[tf]               It starts out when your jaw starts feeling rather uncomfortable.  You try to work it around, and then the rest of your face when the odd stiffness spreads, rubbing your cheeks, forehead, and neck with your $HANDS$.  Suddenly, a few loud CRACKS are heard, and you instantly feel better... until you glance in the mirror.  Your lips, nose, and eyes haven't changed, but the overall shape of your head has.  Your features may be masculine, but you head is definitely that of a woman.;[status]               In an overall odd effect, you have masculine features on a feminine head.  Your chin is much softer then before, and your cheekbones are a good deal higher then they used to be, but your lips, eyes and nose... those are still male.;[short]               feminine head with masculine features;[tgShade]            face 40;[STAGE] 3;[tf]               Your face starts to feel sore and stiff again.  The feeling sends some good tingles to your $GROIN$, and you have a suspicion on what it's going to do, so you try to resist... but soon it's too much, and you rue all over your face with your $HANDS$.  There's no CRACK this time, but pretty soon you definitely feel better, and when you look in the mirror... to no surprise... that the rest of your face has followed the lead set by your head, becoming soft and feminine.;[status]               Your female face now has female features to go with it.  At least it's not odd to look at anymore, but your soft lips and wide eyes make you feel flushed and nervous.  It is framed, rather well, actually, by your $HAIR$, but that just makes the whole thing even more embarrassing.;[short]               soft and feminine face;[tgShade]            face 60;[WaitFor]           hair 2;[WaitFor]           mind 2;[STAGE] 4;[tf]               You feel something settling onto your face.  You're not sure what it is, but you have a suspicion... which is confirmed with a worried gulp when you look in the mirror.  Makeup.  Magic makeup, it seems.  Your cheeks have an excellent, gentle blush on them, and your now blue eyes have artistically done eyeliner enhancing them.  Your lips are now even a kissable bright pink color.  The look is amazingly well done, gentle, but it still seems to send a 'wanting' look... you try to rub some of it off with your $HANDS$, but it seems unwilling to be removed.  Your $GROIN$ moistens when you realize what this means... you will be unable to look like you do not want sex.;[status]               Your face looks like that of a gorgeous young woman looking for a date.  Looking for a fun date.  You don't look slutty by any means, but you certainly look attractive enough that getting someone to not flirt with you then otherwise.  What's worse (or, so your $MIND$ tells you in your weaker moments, better) is that the makeup seems stuck to your face... unable to be removed at all.;[short]               made up female face;[tgShade]            face 80;[WaitFor]           mind 5;[STAGE] 5;[tf]               You feel your face changing again, and with an odd combination of dread and anticipation that you're growing uncomfortably familiar with, you take a look in a mirror... and gasp at what you see.  Whereas before your face was undeniably pretty, now you look gorgeous.  In a porn star way.  You lips are an even brighter pink and seem stuck on an 'O' shape, the structure of your face and the shape of your eyes leads to an unintelligent look, and your makeup is wanton.  Part of you is horrified, but a larger part wants to giggle in glee.;[status]               Your face looks like that of a bimbo porn star.  Your lips are stuck in an 'O', shape, perfect for sucking a man's cock.  Your eyes are a vibrant blue, but with how the structure of your face is and the size of your eyes, even you have a hard time believing in your intelligence when you look in the mirror.  And your makeup practically screams 'fuck me'.  If anybody would have taken you seriously, despite everything else... they won't now.  And you have difficulty crying out in pleasure at the thought.;[short]               bimbo porn star face;[tgShade]            face 100;[WaitFor]           mind 6;[BODY];[STAGE] 0;[status]               You are at a nice height of 5'11'', and you clearly take pains to look good.  You're not vain enough  (about your looks) to claim to be a super model, but because your visible health, good posture, and confident attitude tends to ensure that you are the most attractive person in the room, even if, physically, you are not.;[short]               tall, confident body;[tgShade]            body 0;[STAGE] 1;[tf]               With a sense of dread, you can tell something else is happening by the change in... well, everything.  Suddenly, everything looks just a bit bigger.  It takes a moment for to realize that you have shrunken a couple of inches.  This won't help your new sense of nerves...;[status]               You have recently shrunken a couple of inches down to five foot nine.  It's not an embarrassing height, it's around average... the big problem is that suddenly everything looks bigger to you, and combined with your $MIND$...;[short]               average body;[tgShade]            body 14;[WaitFor]           mind 1;[STAGE] 2;[tf]               You suddenly find everything a bit taller then you again... and you realize that you must have shrunken another couple of inches.  You're outright short, now.  If it wasn't for your $SHOES$, you'd be noticeably smaller then everybody else... and with how your body has softened, your original shape is getting further and further away...;[status]               You have shrunken a good four inches, leaving you at a short five foot seven.  Even if you could ignore that, which you can't with the way it echoes around your $MIND$ constantly, your entire body has become rather softer then it was when you started.;[short]               short, soft body;[tgShade]            body 28;[WaitFor]           mind 2;[STAGE] 3;[tf]               When you shrink another two inches, you have to repress a small shiver of fear... everything is so much BIGGER then you!  You're around the average height of a woman, now, and you can't help but wonder how they deal with this on a day to day bases.  As if that wasn't enough, you can feel your body starting to change its shape, bit by bit.  The V shape you had with your chest was all but gone already, but now it's completely vanished, leaving something a bit softer behind it.;[status]               Your body is, for you, a terrifying place to be.  You have lost a total of six inches, reducing your 5'11'' to a 5'5''.  That is approximately average height for a woman, true, but you are much more used to the height of a man.  Everything looks much more intimidating then you are used to, and it is throwing you off your game.;[short]               soft body that is the average height of a woman;[tgShade]            body 42;[STAGE] 4;[tf]               Your entire body is weak, your clothing is painfully pleasurable, and you've already lost half a foot in height... and then, to your terror, you lose another two inches.  You are now actively small for a woman, at least in the United States, and to make it worse you can see in the mirror can see in the mirror that your entire body, in part due to your $SHIRT$, $PANTS$ and $SHOES$, is starting to take on a whole new shape...;[status]               Your body feels alien to you, in a terrifying way.  Even if you could ignore the fact that you've lost half a foot, eight inches, in height, leaving you at a petite 5' 3'' (which you cant, your $MIND$ won't let you), you can see that your body is starting to reshape itself into something that is anything but male.;[short]               weak, soft, slightly reshaped body the size of a small woman;[tgShade]            body 57;[WaitFor]           breasts 3;[WaitFor]           arms 3;[WaitFor]           legs 3;[STAGE] 5;[tf]               You whimper to yourself as you see the world get bigger again, probably by another couple of inches.  You're shrinking and shrinking and shrinking... when will it end?  The only good thing seems to be that at least you seem to be breathing a bit easier...;[status]               You have shrunk yet another two inches.  You have now lost a total of ten, leaving you at a small five foot one.  The only good thing (though your $MIND$ can't help but regret it) is that you seem to have an easier time breathing now, despite your $SHIRT$.;[short]               weak, soft, small body that is somehow helping you breath;[tgShade]            body 71;[WaitFor]           shirt 3;[WaitFor]           mind 4;[STAGE] 6;[tf]               You shrink again and, looking up, you can tell despite your $SHOES$ that your body has lost a full foot in height.  Your heels raise up up some of that again, of course, but without them you're not even five feet tall!  You start to take quicker and quicker breaths, worry filling you... until you notice, and are distracted by, the ease with which you breath.  Your $SHIRT$ doesn't even hurt as much anymore.  Why is that...?;[status]               You have lost a full foot of height, leaving you at a petite 4' 11''.  Even with your $SHOES$ everything looks big to you, bigger and scarier.  Which, to your shame, makes you hot and horny.  The odd thing, though, is that despite your $SHIRT$, you seem to be breathing easier now, like your body fits inside it.  You're not sure what's going on, but it worries you.;[short]               petite body that somehow fits better inside your corset;[tgShade]            body 85;[WaitFor]           mind 5;[STAGE] 7;[tf]               You practically yelp as you shrink again, more then the previous times.  If you had to guess, you'd say around three inches... at least you seem to have stopped now.  You ignore the twinge of disappointment that thought sends you, and instead focus on how it's suddenly much easier to breath.  The corset is still pressing you tight, of course, and deep breaths are beyond you, but you no longer feel like you're going fall down from lack of oxygen.  You take a look in the mirror... and remember what you used to hear about wearing a corset for your figure.  If you tighten it a bit every day before going to bed, eventually your body will reshape to fit.  It's dangerous, and unhealthy, but it gives you the figure of Jessica Rabbit... a figure you now have.  The thought very nearly makes your orgasm.;[status]               Not only are you now a tiny four foot eight, fifteen inches, five fourths of a foot smaller then when you started, it seems your body has been reshaped to fit your $SHIRT$.  It's a dangerous process, not good for the health... and yet the figure it gives, or gave, you is amazing.  If you want people to treat you as a sex object.  Which you can't help but desire.;[short]               tiny soft reshaped body;[tgShade]            body 100;[WaitFor]           mind 6;[VOICE];[STAGE] 0;[status]               Your baritone voice is as deep and calm as ever.  It's not as deep as some that you've heard... but then, you're not a muscle man.  Or black.  Was that racist?  Whatever... the point is, your voice, while not deep enough to send shivers down a young girls spine, is more then enough that nobody mistakes your gender over the phone.;[short]               deep, steady baritone;[tgShade]            voice 0;[STAGE] 1;[tf]               Your voice cracks a bit, reminding you, embarrassingly, of puberty.  You thought you left those days behind, but apparently your voice box had other ideas.  After a few moments of testing it out, you find you can't speak in your normal register... you sound a bit higher.  Maybe a tenor.  Still a male voice, but not nearly as deep as you would like.;[status]               You seem to have gone through a bit of a reverse puberty, so to speak.  It's nothing too bad... it's just that, unfortunately, your voice is less 'male' and more 'masculine gender-neutral'.  You shouldn't have any problems with it... but it's still rather annoying.;[short]               hgih, for a male, tenor;[tgShade]            voice 25;[WaitFor]           mind 1;[STAGE] 2;[tf]               Your voice cracks again, and you run your $HANDS$ over your throat as you do, feeling your adam's apple changing.  After your voice finally settles down, you realize -- to your embarrassment -- that when you speak, it's in a perfectly androgynous voice.  Not male, or female... this is not a good thing.;[status]               Your voice has gone a bit higher, again, reaching an odd level where you can't really tell gender by the voice.  It's not high, and it's not deep... your $MIND$ makes you feel nervous when you think about it.;[short]               perfectly androgynous voice;[tgShade]            voice 50;[WaitFor]           mind 1;[STAGE] 3;[tf]               You start choking a bit, feeling something lodged in your throat.  You hack and cough, your $BODY$ having a hard time getting rid of it, before it suddenly slides down your throat.  You raise your $HANDS$ to your throat, and see if you can discover what went wrong.  You feel nothing out of place, just a smooth neck... you swallow down your dread.  No adam's apple.  You test your voice a few times, and it has, indeed, raised another register, this time to an alto.  You flush with embarrassment.;[status]               Your voice has risen yet again, after your adam's apple forced it's way back into your system.  Your voice is now an alto... a deeper then average female voice, but a female voice non the less.;[short]               light alto;[tgShade]            voice 75;[WaitFor]           mind 3;[STAGE] 4;[tf]               Your voice cracks again, and it takes a few moments for it to settle.  When it does, you cautiously open your lips and try out a few words, and as you expected, your voice has risen again... this time to a soprano.  Possibly even higher.  And when combined with your $SHIRT$, you find yourself naturally sounding breathless... and with your $MIND$, aroused.  You sound like you want it... and, despite trying to keep your thoughts under control, you do.;[status]               Your voice appears to have settled around a soprano, a high, feminine voice.  But that's not the end of it.  When combined with your $SHIRT$, and your $MIND$ and $GROIN$, you sound breathless and aroused.  Which you are.  You feel ashamed, but that only makes the problem worse.  You love the cycle you're in despite yourself.;[short]               breathless and aroused feminine voice;[tgShade]            voice 100;[WaitFor]           mind 5;[PANTS];[STAGE] 0;[status]               Like everything else you buy, your dress pants are exude wealth, confidence and suave intellect.  Or, at least, that's what the store owner told you.  They are nice, expensive, slightly lighter then black pants from Italy.  They cover the entirety of your legs and cleanly pressed.  They are nice and soft to the touch, ending right at your $SHOES$.;[short]               nice, expensive, soft black pants;[tgShade]            pants 0;[STAGE] 1;[tf]               You hold back a curse when it's suddenly much harder to move.  You take a quick glance down, and discover, to your annoyance, that your pants have suddenly become, essentially, a pair of skinny jeans.  You run your $HANDS$ down the surface, and are a bit relieved to discover that at least the texture is the same.;[status]               Your expensive pair of suit pants have managed to shrink to the exact size of your legs.  You can feel the resistance as you move, and it's essentially a pair of skinny jeans.  More or less... it still has the same expensive, soft texture, at least, and it still ends right at your $SHOES$.;[short]               extra-skinny pair of soft black pants;[tgShade]            pants 16;[STAGE] 2;[tf]               You can feel your pants changing again, but, to your relief, they don't get any tighter.  They only raise up a few inches, showing some of your $LEGS$ before your $SHOES$.

They have managed to gain a particularly shiny and latexy feel, losing all of its old italian charm.  They look a bit cheap, to your eyes, and not something a respectable businessman would wear.;[short]               latex pants that end a few inches above your shoes;[tgShade]            pants 33;[STAGE] 3;[tf]               Your $LEGS$ are suddenly forced a good deal closer together, as the split of your pants suddenly lowers a good three inches.  Given the stiff nature of the latex, you find you can't take big steps like you used to... you're practically trapped in this thing.  The fear and frustration that causes sends another small tingle to your $GROIN$, but you ignore it as you try (and fail) to tug this tight thing off of your waist.;[status]               What used to be ice, expensive italian pants are now beginning to resemble a latex hobble skirt, the kind that restricts your steps to small, tiny, mincing steps.  You can still take steps beyond that, given that it splits into pants a few inches down, but not by much.;[short]               latex combination of a hobble skirt and skinny jeans;[tgShade]            pants 50;[WaitFor]           mind 2;[STAGE] 4;[tf]               Your $SHOES$ squeak as they forcibly slide closer together as your pants change again.  After forcing yourself back to a proper balance, a feet quite difficult with your $ARMS$ and $LEGS$, you take a look down and see, to no real surprise, that your skirt has finished forming.  It lays tight around the waist, makes it all but impossible to move your feet more then a few inches at a time.  The feeling of helplessness you get while wearing it... you have to force down a shiver to focus back on the game.;[status]               Your nice soft pants have been completely transformed into a long, ridiculously constraining hobble skirt.  It reaches down past your knees, and makes it so yo have to shuffle if you want to move at all.  You couldn't run if you wanted to, let alone walk.  Weak... helpless... your $MIND$ is making it harder and harder to think of this as anything but a gift.;[short]               latex hobble skirt;[tgShade]            pants 66;[WaitFor]           mind 4;[STAGE] 5;[tf]               You gasp in surprise and barely prevent yourself from jumping when you suddenly feel a cool breeze at your back legs.  You reach your $HANDS$ down to feel what's wrong, and quickly blush in embarrassment... and pleasure.  Large sections of the back of your hobble skirt have disappeared, leaving not only your $BUTT$ more or less free to see, but most of your $LEGS$, as well.  You look like a slut... and that makes you so wet.;[status]               Your latex hobble skirt has had large swathes of the back cut out, leaving most of your legs and your $BUTT$ free for the world to see.  You feel the cold air occasionally slip in, which makes you shiver... though the shiver is more in the pleasure you get from your humiliation then the cold air.  What looks like fishnet is keeping the skirt as tight as ever, so you're just as restrained as before.;[short]               latex hobble skirt revealing your rear and most of your legs;[tgShade]            pants 83;[WaitFor]           mind 5;[WaitFor]           butt 4;[STAGE] 6;[tf]               Suddenly, you feel a cold breeze from the front of your legs, very similar to what you feel in the back.  You take a look down, dread causing anticipation, as you see that a large hole has appeared in the front of the hobble skirt... revealing your $GROIN$ and a good portion of your upper thigh.  You gasp, then whimper in pleasure, as everybody sees your slit suddenly get wetter by a degree of magnitudes.  You don't know what happened to your underwear... but your $MIND$ hopes it doesn't come back.;[status]               Your backless hobble skirt is now a backless, crotchless hobble skirt.  Your $GROIN$ is free for everybody to see, and you know everybody is staring it at it.  You want to pretend that you don't want this, that you're not getting any pleasure from this... but from how you can't help but turn to show your front to every camera you see, you have no doubt you're not fooling anyone.;[short]               backless, crotchless latex hobble skirt;[tgShade]            pants 100;[WaitFor]           mind 6;[WaitFor]           groin 5;[FEET];[STAGE] 0;[status]               Your feet are your feet.

What you did NOT expect was for your heels to start rising up off of the back of your shoes... like they're more comfortable higher. They float around a half an inch above your heels, and when you force them back down, you feel an uncomfortable burning sensation.  Your stomach drops... it seems your feet have reformed.;[status]               Your feet are around seven inches long, and most likely rather feminine, but that's not the biggest change.  No, the biggest change is that your feet seem to have change... any shoe with less then a two inch heel causes a burning sensation in your feet.

You try to fit your heels back onto your $SHOES$, but all that comes of that is a painful burning sensation that goes straight to your $GROIN$.;[status]               Your feet's tendons have been adjusted again.  If you where to walk around without any shoes on, your heels would naturally rise up to four inches above the ground.

Your $GROIN$ practically gushes when you consider that it could reach up to six... or even seven!  You get so lost in your pain filled, submissive fantasy, that you can't stop yourself from feeling a a pang of regret when they stop at five inches.  When you realised what you were thinking, you shake your head, trying to shake yourself out of it.;[status]               Your petite feet have had their arches shortened again, so that the heels naturally rest at five inches above the ground.  But that's not the worst of it... the worst of it is that you can't keep your $MIND$, and your $GROIN$, off of fantasies where the heels can't go below six inches, or even seven!;[short]               impossibly reformed feet;[tgShade]            feet 100;[WaitFor]           mind 5;[WaitFor]           groin 5;[HANDS];[STAGE] 0;[status]               Your hands are, unfortunately, a bit thicker then you'd like.

Now, that is is something you rather like... they look a bit more elegant now, more befitting a high class business man such as yourself.;[status]               In a surprising bit of good fortune, your hands have thinned and lengthened just enough to be properly elegant on a males body.

The fingers look longer, thinner, almost... dainty?  They're not the hands you'd expect to see on a man, anyway.;[status]               Your hands have shrunken again, and now they look almost out of place on a male body.  They look softer, too.  At least the nails, while well trimmed, are still short.;[short]               dainty hands;[tgShade]            hands 50;[STAGE] 3;[tf]               You feel an odd sensation in your hands, and you lift them up to take a better look, letting you see the slightly disturbing phenomenon of your nails growing out to a length that is, perhaps, a few millimeters beyond fashionable.  They are obviously well taken care of, looking like they just had a manicure... and that perception extends as a bright pink color starts filling out the nails.  You let a blush rise up to your $FACE$... they look so feminine.;[status]               Your nails have grown out into what looks like a professional manicure, long and elegant.  The thought of the difficulty that's going to cause you in your day to day life makes you shiver a bit, but what really gets to you is how these kinds of nails are not the kind anybody would expect a professional woman... person... to wear.

An incredibly intricate, incredibly gorgeous pattern made of something similar to what you use to decorate cakes is done in white on your nails.  You know you could easily brush it off, but you can't... you love it too much.  You know you'd be devastated if something happened to them, and you know how much care you're going to have to take to avoid that.  You shiver at the thought, biting back a wanton moan.;[status]               Your pink nails now have the most impossible gorgeous pattern done out in white on them.  It looks so perfect, so pretty, that you feel dread in your stomach at the idea of something happening to them.

It's not the kind of body glamorized on TV shows that include beaches, but there's no extra fat, the muscles are visible if not blatant, and you're clearly more fit than the average man.  You even have a bit of a 'V' shape going with your noticeable, if not overly broad, shoulders.;[short]               strong, good looking chest;[tgShade]            breasts 0;[STAGE] 1;[tf]               One moment, you're playing like normal, and the next you suddenly feel heavier.  You can tell through your $SHIRT$ that most of your muscles have, more or less, vanished, as has your chest hair.  That is really annoying.  Going to the gym takes time, time you sometimes don't have, but it looks like you'll have to MAKE time after this game is over.;[status]               You still have a V shaped chest, more or less, but the muscles that went with it have all but vanished.  You still have enough left that you wouldn't be embarrassed on the beach, but you do feel rather weaker because of it.;[short]               masculine, if soft, chest;[tgShade]            breasts 14;[STAGE] 2;[tf]               With a sense of dread deep in your stomach, you can feel yourself getting weaker again.

You aren't 'unhealthy', per say, but now you are, in regards to strength, average -- possible a bit weak.;[status]               Your once impressive muscles have faded into non-existance.  You don't have any flab, thankfully, but your muscles... those are gone.  It would take forever and a half to get them back up to par without the help of puberty.  At least you aren't unhealthy... though you do feel rather week.;[short]               muscleless chest;[tgShade]            breasts 28;[WaitFor]           mind 1;[STAGE] 3;[tf]               You suddenly feel light headed as your chest is altered again.  You look down, and can see your $SHIRT$ pressing hard against your chest... and that any muscle that was getting in its way is now gone.  Your chest is weaker then ever, and even if your $ARMS$ and $LEGS$ could support it, you doubt that you'll be able to do any exercise without collapsing into exhaustion;[status]               Your chest is pathetically weak, so much so that there are times when you're almost certain that you can feel your heart about to bust out of it.  What's worse is that, because of your weak chest and your $SHIRT$, you can occasionally feel a loud and painful 'CRACK' as your chest is forced into a new shape, which your $MIND$ then sends straight to your $GROIN$...;[short]               pathetically weak chest;[tgShade]            breasts 42;[WaitFor]           mind 3;[STAGE] 4;[tf]               You feel a slight push against your $SHIRT$ and, looking down, can see that two small, persistent bumps have grown out despite how hard your top squeezes you.  Those things will make it even worse, you realize with a light flush of excitement that you quickly try to squash.;[status]               Your soft chest appears to have grown a very small pair of breasts.  They strain against your $SHIRT$, as if trying to get free, and they are making breathing even more difficult then it already is.;[short]               tiny breasts on your soft chest;[tgShade]            breasts 57;[STAGE] 5;[tf]               You have to resist a gasp of pain when the bumps on your chest start to fill out, straining against your $SHIRT$, now quite obviously a pair of breasts.  Fortunately, though part of you insists that it actually isn't, it lets up a bit so that you can still breath.  When the painful process of growing breasts is done, you take a moment to look down and admire them.  They look like they could be a decent handful.... and a tiny part of you wants them to grow bigger.;[status]               You now have breasts.  They don't seem to be large, and they don't seem to be too small... handfuls, perhaps.  They seem quite heavy to you on your weak $BODY$, throwing off your balance completely.;[short]               small breasts on your weak chest;[tgShade]            breasts 71;[WaitFor]           mind 4;[STAGE] 6;[tf]               You very nearly fall down as your breasts grow again.  Without the corset covering them, it is true that you can breath easier, but it also no longer supports them.  At all.  With the weak shape your $BODY$ is in, bigger breasts can really destroy your balance, especially on your $SHOES$.  And... and damn it all, you love that.  You look in the mirror, and see that your breasts are now bouncing free in the air.  hey aren't huge, but they are definitely big... big enough that you'd have trouble covering them with your $HANDS$.  And everybody is staring at them... their hard nipples... your obvious arousal... you squirm in place, making the shape of your $MIND$ all the more obvious...;[status]               Your breasts have grown again, floating out in the air for the world to see.  You're not an expert, but you'd say they are around C cup... a healthy C cup.  Your face is flushed, and you can't help but think about how obvious your arousal is now, with your nipples painfully erect.  You'd draw your $HANDS$ over them, but you just feel too embarrassed to even consider that right now.;[short]               free floating healthy C breasts;[tgShade]            breasts 85;[WaitFor]           shirt 5;[STAGE] 7;[tf]               You can't help but moan in anticipation as you feel your breasts getting ready to change again.  Fully aware of the eyes staring at you, and perhaps because of them, you raise one of your $HANDS$ to your breasts. You hesitate for a moment, but when your breast literally grows into your hand, and your nipple rubs against your hand, you gasp... and then moan as you proceed to massage your breasts with both your hands.  You think that they're somewhere around a D cup, but something tells your that they're closer to an E.  You're too distracted at the moment to take a careful look, though.;[status]               Your breasts have grown to what you think is their final stage... somewhere around a DD, or possibly an E.  They float in the air like they've never heard of gravity, and they feel so good you can barely keep your hands off of them.  A large part of the thrill, to you, is the knowledge that everybody is watching... staring... the humiliation and embarrassment is making you light headed...;[short]               free floating DD to E cup breasts that you can barely keep your hands off of;[tgShade]            breasts 100;[WaitFor]           mind 6;[ARMS];[STAGE] 0;[status]               Your arms are nice and strong, a bit thick with muscle... and, most importantly, able to pop up quite nicely when flirting with girls.

You roll one sleeve up, and discover that your arms have weakened .  It's not like they're flabby, but when you try to show your arm muscle, you can only see a fraction of what you had before.  You will have to fix that later.;[status]               Your arms are, while not useless, much weaker then they were before.  Whereas you used to be able to lift four or five heavy boxes of reports, you'd now have to push for two, and would struggle with three.  It's rather annoying being weaker then you used to.;[short]               slightly muscled arms;[tgShade]            arms 25;[STAGE] 2;[tf]               While you are supporting yourself on a nearby rail with you $HANDS$, your arms suddenly weaken, causing you to have a quick scare from the sudden, and momentary, loss of support on your upper body.  You take a quick look, only to confirm what you already know... your arms have just lost another pound of muscle, leaving them soft, feminine, and hairless.;[status]               Your arms have shrunken again, leaving most of the muscles just... gone.  You'd have trouble doing any heavy lifting with these arms, but you suppose it would be possible if you had to push yourself.  The ore drastic change is how female, and soft they look.;[short]               soft feminine arms;[tgShade]            arms 50;[STAGE] 3;[tf]               Your arms go wide for a moment in surprise as you feel something soft just... appear on them.  You teeter in your $SHOES$ for just a bit before you recover enough to take a good lock.  It looks like some stockings have appeared on your arm, made for you arm.  You don't have much experience with them, but you believe they are called 'arm sleeves'... though you haven't seen one that makes the arms look as good as these do before.;[status]               Your gentle, weak arms have gotten a pair of arm sleeves to appear on them, encasing them.  Surprisingly, they don't seem to quite reach your $HANDS$ or shoulders, but nor do they seem to be moving around.  They look lacy and black, almost like a pair of stockings, and make your arms look even more feminine then before.;[short]               weak arms covered with stocking like arm sleeves;[tgShade]            arms 75;[WaitFor]           mind 5;[STAGE] 4;[tf]               The weight on your arms suddenly increase.

You know that they won't ever break or tear... and you know that somebody could easily tie them together... or to the posts of a bed... leaving you helpless... unable to move... you barely bite back a moan and return to reality, but don't even consider removing the arm sleeves.;[status]               Your arm sleeves have somehow gained rows of rings, made out of a similar material as the rest of it.  They actually enhance the look of the whole thing, but you know what you really love about them, despite your attempts to not, is how it would be for anyone to grab them... tie them together... leaving you squirming and helpless...;[short]               easily bound weak arms covered in arm sleeves;[tgShade]            arms 100;[WaitFor]           mind 6;[BUTT];[STAGE] 0;[status]               Your rear end is a bony land of flat.

Your butt... it's not bony anymore!  That's a good thing, at least... chairs should be a bit more comfortable, now.;[status]               Your bony butt has inflated just a bit.

Moreso then should really be on a man... more what you'd expect on a masculine woman.;[status]               Your butt has plumped up a bit more, poking out a bit.

Your $MIND$ makes you flush with embarrassment as you hope that you can make the swelling go down latter.;[status]               You now have a rather nice butt, filling out your $PANTS$ quite nicely.

It takes a few moments for it to finish, and when it does you turn around to see the rather pleasant sight of a very nicely filled out behind, the kind that could draw looks from spinning heads as one walked.  You run your $HANDS$ over it as you fantasize, before shaking yourself out of it and quickly returning to the game.  Nobody seems to have missed it, though, and as your face flushes with embarrassment your $GROIN$ gets wet...;[status]               Your rear is now 'pleasantly plump'.  It would fill out any kind of clothing quite well, but it works especially well with your $PANTS$.

You can help but run your $HANDS$ over your soft, sensuous, and jiggly ass.  This is the kind of butt that causes car wrecks.    Before you can stop yourself, your $MIND$ imagines walking in the grocery store, when a man passes by and slaps your butt, and you moan, and he does it again, and --;[status]               Your butt has filled out more then nicely.  It is every inch a bouncy, perky, oh-so-grabbable bubble butt.  It fills out your $PANTS$ perfectly, and when you walk it seems to sway with an inviting jiggle.  You want to hate it... but you can't do anything but love it.;[short]               grabbable bubble butt;[tgShade]            butt 100;[WaitFor]           mind 5;[LEGS];[STAGE] 0;[status]               Your legs are nice and strong, which is useful, as you need them for walking.

It won't hinder your day to day activities, but your legs will feel like jelly walking up stairs until you build them back up.;[status]               Your legs are like any other pair of male legs.  That is, annoying weak.

They look like the kind of legs a girl would have.;[status]               Your legs are even weaker now, which you suppose makes sense given that they now look like they belong on a girl.

They just look even more slender and beautiful than before.;[status]               Your legs are weaker then you can ever remember them being, and look like they belong to a girl who has never had to even walk long distances for her entire life.

You hope they change that, at least, back when you win.;[status]               Your monster of a member has shrunken down to an average sized cock.

You feel so emasculated...;[status]               Your cock has shrunk again... whereas before it went down from ten to six, this time it went down from six to two.

You take a look down to your $PANTS$, and see... nothing.  Nothing at your crotch.  You run your hands over your crotch, and as you feared, your balls are now gone.  In their place is a tiny slit.  Fortunately, you can still feel your cock... though it's so small it's hard to call it that.  When you run your $HANDS$ over it, you take in a sudden gasp, your knees shaking.  Your cock was never THAT sensitive!;[status]               Your cock has all but vanished, and your balls HAVE vanished.  A tiny slit is left behind, though you can't really feel it.

You gasp with your $VOICE$, as much as your $SHIRT$ will allow anyway, at just how sensitive it is, before you quickly retract it with a blush on your face.;[status]               It is official.  You are no longer male.  Your cock has, quite literally, vanished.  You could not even a imagine a bulge in your $PANTS$ if you tried.

It all just feels so good!  It feels like your pussy is alive, squirming, begging to be satisfied... somehow.

You'd try to get this off, but you're distracted by the raging hard on in your $GROIN$... every tingle of pain is like a kiss of pleasure.  It's then that you realize it ... you've become a masochist.;[status]               Somehow, this show has turned you into a masochist.

Your $BUTT$ and your &PANTS$ ensure your walk is that of a female, as if your $SHOES$ didn't do the job already.  If you saw someone like yourself walking down the street, there's no way you'd take here seriously.

Every change is like a finger in your &GROIN&, and each one is worse then the last... which makes it feel better to you.  Every time your looks change, you know less people are going to take you seriously, ore are going to try to take advantage of you.  With every clothing change, they hurt more, restrict more, and that sends all sorts of pleasure down.

No matter how you try to hide it, you're female.  Women do nothing for you, but the idea of a strong man holding you down... you know it and you know they have to know it.

When at first it seems like all that's happened is the disappearance of your white undershirt and tie, you start to breath in a sigh of relief... which gets cut off when your tuxedo tightens uncomfortably.  You gasp as air is forced from your lungs, your $BREASTS$ and $BODY$ unable to resist the force of the tuxedo.  The styling seems to have changed a bit too, but right you you've gotta focus on the game.;[status]               Your tuxedo has tightened uncomfortably, to the point where deep breaths are beyond you.  You'd take it off if you could, but your $MIND$ repels you from the idea, and when you glance at the buttons in a spare moment you can see that not only on the other side, the entire thing has become more complicated.  Some more buttons, some extra strings... the fastenings have even switched sides!;[short]               extra-fitted tight tuxedo;[tgShade]            shirt 33;[WaitFor]           body 1;[WaitFor]           breasts 2;[STAGE] 3;[tf]               The arms and shoulders of your suit seem to shrink into the rest of it for the sole purpose of making it even tighter.  Any physical exercise in this thing would be a death sentence, but at least you can still breath normally with only slight discomfort.  More or less.  What's more worrying is the fact that the once simple buttons used to remove your top have become complex knots which you couldn't hope to undo while on the show.;[status]               Your suit has now lost its arms and shoulders, revealing your $ARMS$ to the world, at the cost of becoming even tighter then before.  It's clearly cinched a bit at the waist, and even breathing normally is a bit difficult.;[short]               armless annoyingly tight  tuxedo;[tgShade]            shirt 50;[WaitFor]           mind 2;[STAGE] 4;[tf]               Your tux cinches again at your chest, tucking another inch or two in a painful fashion that sends pleasant tingles to your $GROIN$.  Despite yourself, you start imagining it tighter and tighter, and have to fight yourself to pull your $MIND$ away from your fantasies.  When you get yourself back under control, you realize your tuxedo has gone through a few more changes.  Like how it's now a shiny latex, like your $SHOES$, and the knots keeping it closed are in your back.  With a gulp, you realize that it's now more like a corset then a tuxedo.;[status]               Your tuxedo has become a shiny latex corset.  You feel feint occasionally as it's difficult to get enough oxygen into your chest, and you are as trapped inside of it as you could possibly be.  Their are no buttons or easy to undo fixtures, just a series of knots in the back.  Horribly complicated knots, leaving you trapped, helpless, in pain... you can't help but love it.;[short]               black latex corset;[tgShade]            shirt 66;[WaitFor]           mind 4;[WaitFor]           groin 4;[STAGE] 5;[tf]               Your corset gets tighter and tighter... it's getting harder and harder to breath, and for a terrifying moment you start to believe you'll die, before suddenly your breasts pop free.  You take a few deep breaths (well, deep for while you're wearing this thing) to recover, and when you no longer feel like you're going to fall down, you take a look down and see that, not only has your corset gotten tighter, but the section that was restraining the breasts now... isn't.  Shiny black latex goes between and around them, but doesn't cover them.  You're not sure if the humiliation from bare breasts is better then the pain from constraining them, and you spend a moment mentally debating it before you force your $MIND$ back to the game.;[status]               Your shiny black latex corset now lets your $BREASTS$ roam free.  It's tighter then ever, but without your breasts in the way, you can actually breath a little easier.  However, you still squirm in embarrassment at having your breasts free to see, the world staring at their hard nipples...;[short]               breastless black latex corset;[tgShade]            shirt 83;[WaitFor]           breasts 5;[WaitFor]           mind 6;[STAGE] 6;[tf]               You feel your cortex cinch tighter again, but your gasp of pain is cut off by the dread filled sound of a lock.  From behind your back.  You slowly maneuver yourself so that you can see the back of your corset... and see a lock.  A small lock, but a lock non the less.  You are locked in corset, and the sight instantly makes you moan, loudly and lewdly.;[status]               Your latex corset is almost exactly the same as it was before... save for one large difference.  All of the fixtures run through a small lock in the back.  You couldn't get out of this corset even if you wanted to, and that feels so good that you can't help but wish you never will.;[short]               locked black latex corset;[tgShade]            shirt 100;";

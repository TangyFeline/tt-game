[Desc]               <blue>Chandler Jacobson is your opponent tonight, and he stands at a podium not far from you. Before the show started you talked with him, and he seems like a pretty good guy. He's a little nerdy, but he hides is well enough. It's clear that he really needs the money for this, and even though he doesn't hold anything against you, he wants to win this game.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>"Oh well, I gave it my best shot," Chan'leear says to you with a kind smile. She walks over to you and shakes your hand. "Good luck with the prize money." You ask her about what she's going to, she seemed like she really needed that money. She chuckles, an adorable gesture on her, and says, "Oh, don't worry about that. I think I'll be able to make the money I need now, with this body. I've got the whole alien look going for me, plus my charming personality." With that you can still see a glimmer of the original Chandler in her, and you can tell she's happy. You watch her walk away, hips swaying seductively, and note that you'll have to try out her act when she gets settled in. As a friend, of course.</pink>;

[FACE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Chandler has a very average men's face. His nose is a little big, and he has a thin beard.;
[short]               masculine face;
[tgShade]            face 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Chandler wipes his hands on his $PANTS$, a nervous gesture, and fails to notice that his facial hair has completely disappeared from his face.;
[status]               Chandler has a very average man's face, but with no facial hair at all.;
[short]               cleanly shaved face;
[tgShade]            face 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               "Did you hear the joke about the roof?" Chandler asks in his $VOICE$, trying to ignore his last loss. "I tell you, it'll go right over your head!" Some of the audience laughs at that, but others are focused on his face, as are you. It's losing it's harder edges, the lines of his jaw becoming more smooth, and his cheeks are filling out a little. Overall, he now has a very androgynous face.;
[status]               Chandler has the kind of face that makes you wonder about his gender.;
[short]               androgynous face;
[tgShade]            face 66;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Well, that loss did it. Your opponent's eyes grow a little bigger and his head shrinks a little, his nose gets smaller until it looks like a cute button nose, and his lips puff out into something more kissable. Chandler now has a very girly face.;
[status]               Chandler has a girly face with kissable lips, a button nose, doe eyes, the works.;
[short]               girly face;
[tgShade]            face 100;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Chandler looks into the video screen, shocked to see dark red markings appear on her cheeks and replace her eyebrows.;
[status]               Chandler a very feminine face with kissable lips, a cute button nose, and doe eyes. The dark red markings stand out from her $BODY$, giving her a more exotic appeal as well.;
[short]               alien face;
[tgShade]            face 100;
[WaitFor]           groin 1;

[BODY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Chandler has a pretty even tanning across his body.;
[short]               tan skin;
[tgShade]            body 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               There's a yawn from Chandler, as if she wasn't playing a game that held her future in her very hands. The audience definitely appreciates the way it shows off her $BREASTS$, though. That's when you spot it starting on her arms: the tan she walked in with is fading away into a much paler complexion.;
[status]               Chandler has lost the tan she walked in with, and instead has pearly white skin.;
[short]               pale skin;
[tgShade]            body 100;
[WaitFor]           groin 1;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Chandler is drumming her slender fingers across her podium, leaning over in such a way that you know someone in the audience is checking out her $BUTT$. Her eyes widen as she sees the skin of her hand start to change in hue, and she quickly looks herself over to find that all of her skin has gained a light blue tint.;
[status]               Chandler has light blue skin that clearly shows how alien she is becoming.;
[short]               light blue skiin;
[tgShade]            body 100;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You're pretty sure Chandler is a little freaked out by her alien changes, even with her $MIND$. She's been looking at the video screen after every loss, probably because she'd rather see the change like that than by looking down. Sure enough, both of you watch as her skin darkens in color into a deep blue.;
[status]               Chandler has the deep blue skin color of an asari.;
[short]               deep blue skin;
[tgShade]            body 100;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Chandler has a voice somewhere in the middle of pitch. It doesn't sound deep and manly, but it also doesn't have the high pitch associated with ladies.;
[short]               androgynous voice;
[tgShade]            voice 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your opponent's $FACE$ stretches out into a yawn, then he says, "How much longer is this game going to be? There is this thing called 'sleep', y'know." You and the audience are taken aback as you notice that as he talks, his voice rises in pitch, until settling on something several octaves higher than before. "Oh crapbaskets," he says.;
[status]               Chandler has a voice several octaves higher than what is normal for a guy.;
[short]               high voice;
[tgShade]            voice 50;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Chandler yawns again, his stretched arms pushing out his $BREASTS$. "Can we start the next round soon?" he asks, then stares shocked at his own voice. He had sounded very different, his voice not only a little higher, but warmer. The inflections and intonations were just different than how he usually talked. He sounded like a woman.;
[status]               Chandler has a voice that sounds exactly like that of a woman his age.;
[short]               womanly voice;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You're still a little freaked out by your opponent's $MIND$. You ask her what it's like, and she thinks for a second before responding. "Well, it's really not that different from being human, I think. Though if what I remember about the games is right, there will be some added benefits later on..." Somewhere between the first and second sentence, her voice drops a little in pitch, and she puts more emphasis on certain words, like 'benefits'. Her voice is actually pretty sexy now.;
[status]               Chandler has a very sexy, sultry kind of voice.;
[short]               sultry voice;
[tgShade]            voice 100;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Chandler is wearing beige shorts that are baggy on him. It also has quite a few pockets.;
[short]               baggy shorts;
[tgShade]            pants 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Chandler starts doing stretches, and you can see his $MIND$ is still trying to think through the fact he's changing with every loss. The video screen cuts to his $BUTT$, and for a second you wonder if they just wanted a butt shot, but then you see that his shorts are darkening in color, from beige to gray. The shorts also seem smaller, as they're less baggy than they were earlier. There also seem to be less pockets than before.;
[status]               Chandler is wearing gray shorts that fit him better than they did earlier, though it only has a couple pockets now.;
[short]               gray comfy shorts;
[tgShade]            pants 33;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Though the podium slightly blocks your view of Chandler, or rather his lower half, you can see that the few pockets remaining on his shorts disappear, leaving him wearing a pair of women's shorts.;
[status]               Chandler is wearing a pair of gray women's shorts.;
[short]               feminine shorts;
[tgShade]            pants 66;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Chandler ran his hands along his $SHIRT$, obviously trying to smooth out any wrinkles while also doing something to keep his mind off the game. Immediately the screen switches camera angles until it's once again showing a shot of his $BUTT$, but more specifically is showing as his pair of women's shorts shifts and changes into a gray skirt!;
[status]               Chandler is wearing a gray skirt, one that most would say stradles the line between long and medium length.;
[short]               skirt;
[tgShade]            pants 100;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Chandler looks over at you and says, "I really don't like this skirt. It makes me afraid to bend down or anything, I might show something I shouldn't..." As if in response to that, the material of her skirt stretches out and completely covers her legs, turning into tight black pants that show off her $BUTT$ much more than the skirt did. Chandler doesn't look thrilled with the change.;
[status]               Chandler is wearing a pair of tight black pants that show off her $BUTT$.;
[short]               tight black pants;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               The material of your opponent's pants turns into a rubbery substance, and it changes from pants into an extremely short skirt that shows off her $BUTT$ very well. A blush appears on her $FACE$, and Chandler says, "That's a little too revealing, I think.";
[status]               Chandler is wearing a black rubber miniskirt.;
[short]               miniskirt;
[tgShade]            pants 100;

[WAIST];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Chandler has a waist that isn't any less wide than his shoulders, giving him a bit of a tube-shaped figure. ;
[short]               skinny figure;
[tgShade]            waist 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               "Okay, could I BE losing any faster?" Chandler asks, his $VOICE$ sarcastic. Almost immediately his hands fly to his stomach, and the pain of his $FACE$ shows something is going on. You look on as his waist shrinks a little, giving him a bit of an hourglass figure.;
[status]               Chandler has a waist that is a little smaller than when he walked in, and he's starting to get an hourglass figure going.;
[short]               slight hourglass figure;
[tgShade]            waist 100;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Chandler smiles warmly at you with her $FACE$, and you're a little disconcerted by how little she's fazed by all these changes now. You watch as her waist pulls in a little tighter, and her hips widen a little, giving her a real hourglass figure.;
[status]               Chandler has a small waist and wide hips, giving her a real hourglass figure.;
[short]               hourglass figure.;
[tgShade]            waist 100;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;

[BREASTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Chandler has a thin chest with little in the way of muscle or fat.;
[short]               flat chest;
[tgShade]            breasts 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Chandler scratches his chest through his $SHIRT$, obviously something is bothering him.;
[status]               Chandler has a thin, flat chest that seems to be itchy at the moment.;
[short]               itchy chest;
[tgShade]            breasts 25;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Chandler runs his hands through his $HAIR$, still trying to stay calm. Then, a look flashes across his face, clearly he's feeling something. He looks down to see something you had missed: his chest has expanded outwards a little, giving him the beginnings of breasts!;
[status]               Chandler has budding breasts that are hard to notice under his $SHIRT$.;
[short]               budding breasts;
[tgShade]            breasts 50;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Chandler stretches a little, and you struggle not to snicker at the sight of his nipples standing out through his $SHIRT$. Then you see it: his breasts expanding out, gaining mass. By the time it's done, he has two full-fledged breasts on his chest, just ones that are a little small.;
[status]               Chandler has small breasts that stand out from his chest, they look like they'd fit in an A-cup bra.;
[short]               small breasts;
[tgShade]            breasts 75;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Chandler crosses his arms under his breasts, still not used to having them. His $FACE$ flashes with alarm as they grow even larger, ending up being around the average size for women's breasts, maybe a little smaller.;
[status]               Chandler has very average-sized breasts, probably around a B-cup.;
[short]               breasts;
[tgShade]            breasts 100;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Chandler looks down as the top of her $SHIRT$ rises up a little, her breasts growing once again.;
[status]               Chandler has above-average sized breasts, somewhere in the C-cup range.;
[short]               breasts;
[tgShade]            breasts 100;
[WaitFor]           groin 1;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               The $SHIRT$ Chandler is wearing pushes out more as her breasts grow out. She looks down and a faint smile spreads across her $FACE$. "Well, that's not a bad change at all, really," she says in her $VOICE$.;
[status]               Chandler has large breasts, you'd guess they'd fit snuggly in a D-cup bra.;
[short]               large breasts;
[tgShade]            breasts 100;
[WaitFor]           mind 4;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               The video screen cuts to your opponent's backside as she stretches again, this time more lazily and deliberately. The camera really does love her $BUTT$. But that's not what's changing right now. No, instead it's her chest, growing even more until their size draws the eye with an almost magnetic attraction.;
[status]               Chandler has very large breasts, the kind that belong in a DD-cup bra.;
[short]               large breasts;
[tgShade]            breasts 100;

[BUTT];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Chandler has a thin, bony kind of butt that is barely noticable at all through his $PANTS$.;
[short]               bony butt;
[tgShade]            butt 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You and Chandler both watch as one of the mounted video cameras moves around to get a better look at the back of his $PANTS$. You both look at the TV screen, and see his butt expand out a little, so that it's less bony and closer to average for posteriors.;
[status]               Chandler has a very normal looking butt.;
[short]               normal butt;
[tgShade]            butt 50;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               The video screen again cuts to a shot of your opponent's back, for a second focusing on his $WAIST$, but you realize why as you see his butt expand out again, more with fat than muscle, giving him a feminine, curvy butt.;
[status]               Chandler has a very feminine butt made more out of fat than muscle.;
[short]               feminine butt;
[tgShade]            butt 100;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               The video screen once again switched angles to one behind Chandler, so she and everyone else could watch as her butt expanded out further, becoming much curvier.;
[status]               Chandler has a curvy, feminine butt that seems to be drawing more attention from the crowd.;
[short]               curvy butt;
[tgShade]            butt 100;
[WaitFor]           groin 1;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               The video screen once again stops focusing on your opponent's $SHIRT$ so the audience can get a decent view of her $BREASTS$, and instead smash-cuts to her back, and you watch as her butt expands into a full bubble-butt.;
[status]               Chandler has a large bubble butt that really fills out her $PANTS$.;
[short]               bubble butt;

[GROIN];

[status]               Chandler has man parts below the belt, as far as you know.;
[short]               unchanged groin;
[tgShade]            groin 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You look over at Chandler, and it's clear he isn't very comfortable. From his $BREASTS$ to his $BUTT$, Chandler looks like a woman. Hell, his $MIND$ even has him acting like a woman sometimes! He sighs. "Great, the only thing left of my original self is my boys down below. Could this GET any worse?" As if to answer that, his $FACE$ grimaces in pain, and one of his hands flies down to touch the crotch area of his $PANTS$. "Now I don't even have that," he says in his $VOICE$. "I'm 100% woman now.";
[status]               Chandler has lady parts under her $PANTS$.;

[MIND];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Chandler is still the nice, somewhat sarcastic guy he walked in as.;
[short]               sarcastic deposition;
[tgShade]            mind 0;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Chandler stands akimbo, an irritated look on his face. "Could you BE winning more games?" he asks in his $VOICE$, but then you notice that one of his hands has moved up to his face, and has started playing with his $HAIR$ absently while he's talking.;
[status]               Chandler is still very nice and quite sarcastic, but he's also started doing feminine stuff without realizing it.;
[short]               changing deposition;
[tgShade]            mind 50;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               A shudder passes over Chandler before he asks you, "Are you feeling okay? I've been feeling kinda weird. Like, I'm not noticing my changes as much now. It's all starting to seem more...normal.";
[status]               Chandler is still nice and sarcastic, but he's also adjusting to his new body faster than anticipated.;
[short]               adjusting mind;
[tgShade]            mind 100;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Chandler looks down at her changed body, then looks up at you. "Well, that's it. I'm an asari from Mass Effect now. That is a sentence I never thought I would say." She runs one of her blue hands across her $HAIR$, feeling the weird cartilage. "I'm still trying to get used to these..." she says, hefting up one of her $BREASTS$ with one hand, "...and now I also need to get used to being an alien?"

You see a blue light flash through her eyes for a second, and she looks over at the screen curiously. "Then again, it's not too big a change. I'm still humanoid, and my body is appealing to the eye. It could be worse." She sighs in her $VOICE$. "But is that just the game talking, or is that me? I don't even know anymore.";
[status]               Chandler is struggling not only with her new gender, but her new species as well. Part of her wants to accept the changes, but another part is resisting as hard is it can.;

[WaitFor]           pants 4;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Chandler still looks conflicted, unsure about how to feel about her changes. She looks to you, honestly wondering what's the best idea. "If I lose, I'll lose everything. I don't think my job will keep me on, and it'll be hard to find a new one. I'll have to sell all my clothes, and buying new ones will be a hassle, because Jesie Chreesie I hate shopping. Then again..."

Another blue light flashes through her eyes, and you notice that she stands differently now, more confidently. "Asari live for centuries, and can mate with anyone! I can still date women, I can even start a family. My panic at this was unneeded. Sure, it's different, but different doesn't mean 'bad', it's just something new. I'm sure I'll get used to it in time.";
[status]               Chandler has accepted that he might lose and get stuck like this, and he doesn't seem to care all that much.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You catch your opponent's eyes wandering, before locking into a man in the third row. Chandler blushes and coughs before speaking in her $VOICE$, "You know, I think I'm beginning to find men attractive. I suppose that makes sense, considering asari are monogender, but still it's a little odd for me. I myself was a man earlier today, and now...I'd prefer not to describe my feelings, actually.";
[status]               Chandler has not only mostly accepted her new body, but is now finding men attractive.;

[tf]               Chandler looks down at her $BREASTS$, clearly able to be seen through her $SHIRT$, and turns her head to get a better look at her $BUTT$ in her $PANTS$. "This is ridiculous, I look like some sort of adolescent fantasy. I do not like these changes one bit."

But then her eyes wander over the the video screen, and you can see them move across her $WAIST$. Another blue light flashes in her eyes, and she smiles seductively while leaning forward, showing off her goods a little better for the audience. She looks back at the man in the third row and throws him a wink. "Then again, I think these changes have an advantage to them after all...";
[status]               Chandler has completely accepted her changes, in fact she seems to revel in them. Her sexy body is a great way to attract all sorts of attention, attention she seems to crave more and more now.;

[tf]               Chandler takes a languid stretch, drinking in the stares she'd getting from the audience. "Y'know what? I don't think I want to change back. I mean, could I BE more sexy?" She puts a finger to her chin and looks thoughtful, which on her is still a sexual look. "Though, I don't think Chandler is the right name for me, don't you? I mean, I'm not really human anymore. How about...Chan'leear? I think it sounds cute." She turns to the crowd and winks. "What do you think?" There's a round of cheers from the crowd. "Well, Chan'leear it is then. But you can just call me Leear.";
[status]               Chandler is no more. Gone is the sacrastic nerd who walked into the building. Now, there stands Chan'leear, an asari who uses her sexual body for her own gain. She's still very sarcastic, though.;

[tf]               You take a moment to look a little closer at your opponent's $WAIST$, marveling at the fact she was a he not too long ago. Your thought process is interrupted when you notice her hair clumping up into large dreadlocks.;

[tf]               Chandler looks over at the video screen, still a little startled by her $FACE$. You realize that she'll really need to prepare herself for more surprises, as her hair transforms from blonde dreadlocks into the tentacle-like headcrest of an Asari from Mass Effect. It's very weird seeing that alien feature on a real person.;
[status]               Instead of hair, Chandler has the weird tentacle-like crest of an asari.;

[tf]               You watch as the gray shirt Chandler is wearing turns black and changes material into something rubbery and skintight, and it shifts into something that looks like what an asari stripper wears in the Mass Effect games. It shows off every contour of her $BREASTS$, and even has a Power Girl-esque boob window. Chandler looks down at it and frowns. "I might be okay with being an asari, but I don't plan on becoming a stripper!";

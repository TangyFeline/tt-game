[Desc]               <blue>This tall, burly man is probably somewhere in his thirties, but time and sun haven't been kind to him. His face is tanned and leathery, marked by an old claw mark across his left cheek. More recent battles have given him stranger scars--pointed ears, green scales on the backs of his hands, and a blood-red right eye set in a gray metal socket. He's wearing jeans and a shooting jacket, and together with his thick black beard, he looks like a hunting gear ad from a parallel universe.<br><br>

"The three-time champion is back again, folks!" the announcer declares. "Let's give it up for Nigel Whitfeld, the big game hunter who always blows away the competition!" Nigel ignores this, staring confidently at you and waiting to begin.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>"You got me," Nia concedes. "But somehow, I don't feel like I lost." She looks out into the crowd, where the bunny girl is still cheering. "I've got a lot ahead of me. New ways to hunt. New prey to stalk. I'll have to learn everything all over again, and frankly? I can't wait."<br><br>

She turns to walk away, but then suddenly rounds on you. "But seriously, did you have to take my fucking cock?"</pink>;

[tf]               The fur on $MIND$'s chest has completely won out, becoming a fine yellow pelt. It looks a bit softer than a real cat's fur, but no less pleasant to lie against. "I have half a mind to skin myself," he jokes.;

He looks at his face on one of the view screens, tapping his $HANDS$ against the scar on his cheek. It hasn't faded any, and this seems to satisfy him.;

He seems surprisingly calm as he studies his new claws, testing the motions to bare and retract them. He runs one along the podium, leaving a new scratch in the weathered wood. "Impressive," he mutters, "but still damn useless. Give me a gun any day.";

She turns towards the bunny girl, making sure she's caught her eye. Then she bends her neck, finding herself just flexible enough to lick and suck at her own nipples. Her $HANDS$ drop down between her legs, playing and teasing her way to a yowling orgasm.<br><br>

"Damn it!" she protests. "That didn't even take the edge off!";

"Aww, the hunter misses his boomstick?" the bunny girl asks from the audience. "A lion still has paws and claws and a nice big tongue." She licks her lips seductively.<br><br>

But you always keep your marks . . ." the host says, confused. <br><br>

[tf]               Nigel suddenly turns towards the audience. "Hey, you with the baseball cap! I heard that!" He taps his rounded ears. "Don't think I can turn this around, do you? Don't count out Nigel Whitfeld just yet!"<br><br>

The baseball-capped man is too far away for you to hear his response, but whatever he says makes Nigel smile. "I'll forgive you, on one condition. Five letters, two syllables. You know what to say."<br><br>

The man begins the chant, and half the stadium soon echoes it. "Nigel! Nigel! Nigel!";
[status]               He's starting to regain his calm as his fans chant their support.;

[tf]               Nigel sniffs the air. "Something smells good. Really good." <br> <br>

His gaze wanders into the front row of the audience, landing on a prior contestant who stuck around to watch the later rounds. Her loss gave her long red hair, a strapless teddy to hold in her massive breasts, and genuine bunny ears. <br><br>

She smiles vacuously at him. "Ooh, a big scary lion!" she proclaims. "Are you going to eat me up, miss lion?"<br><br>

"Mr.," Nigel corrects. "And that depends. Do you think I can catch you?"<br><br>

"I dunno," she titters. "Why don't you chase me and find out?"<br><br>

"Later," Nigel says reluctantly. "I have to win this match first." He draws in one more deep breath, savoring her scent, then returns to the competition.;
[status]               Nigel's keen senses are both a help and a hindrance, keeping him on his guard, but occasionally distracting him.;

[tf]               You're confused at how easily you beat Nigel last round, until you see him staring off into the audience, smiling at the bunny girl. "Christ on a cracker!" he protests. "I can't fucking play like this! Every third thought keeps going back to knocking boots! Unless . . ." <br><br>

He smirks wickedly, turning his gaze on you. "You're not my usual type," he says, "but you could be fun when I'm through with you. I'll keep my eyes on the prize, so to speak. One way or another, I always eat my catch!";
[status]               He's alarmingly focused on beating you and fucking you.;

[tf]               "And that's another round lost for Nigel Whitfeld!" the host declares. "Could our new contestant be too much for the hunter to handle?"<br><br>

Nigel growls--loudly--and the host panics and hides behind the cameraman. <br><br>

"I'm the biggest badass in Transformania!" Nigel declares. "And if I'm a chick now, I'll just have to be the most badass chick! I've never lost a match, and I don't intend to start now!" <br><br>

The crowd begins to chant, but she swiftly corrects them. "I can't really be a 'Nigel' like this. I'll take that name back when I win. For now . . . Nia. It means 'purpose.' It's a good name for a huntress."<br><br>

She smiles wickedly at you. "This is where we really start playing for keeps. Nigel is done for now, but Nia's gonna wipe the floor with you." ;

She laughs out loud. "That was way too much fun. I've always been big and heavy--it's taken me a lot of practice to learn not to scare animals away. I never thought sneaking around could be so easy.";

"Nah," Nia interjects.<br><br>

The host stares incredulously at her. "You're not going to win?"<br><br>

"I'm not gonna change back," Nia explains. "I've been hunting game for forever and a half. I got so good at it I could catch anything, so I came to Transformania to start hunting men instead. Then I turned out to be good at that, so I've just been treading water. These dinky little claws aren't as good as a gun, but at least they're something new. I'll learn how to hunt all over again--no guns, no gear, just me and the savannah."<br><br>

She winks at the audience. "Of course, with a body like this, I've got more than one new kind of hunting to try out . . ."<br><br>

She turns to face you, calm and determined. "Just a few rounds left, buddy. Let's finish this fair and square.";
[status]               She's calm and collected, determined to win these last few rounds.;

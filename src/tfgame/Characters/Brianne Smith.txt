    [Desc]                  <pink>Your name is Brianne, and you've a single young professional here to try and win big so you can start your own company. Just 26, you work hard as a graphic designer at a large agency, but are impatient to strike out on your own. In the audience is your boyfriend, Cliff McAllister, whom you adore, and who's here as moral support. He was uncertain about you appearing on a program like this, but you reassured him everything was going to be just fine.<br/><br/>You stand an intimidating 6'3", and are otherwise fit and healthy, wearing a smart blouse and sensible pants.</pink>;
    [LoseDesc]              <pink>Gone completely is Brianne Smith, up-and-coming graphic designer, the tall, skinny woman you had been when you woke up this morning, for whom children were a distant concern. Instead, there is Brianne McAllister, happily married, and a proud mother-to-be.<br><br>Perhaps that undersells your devotion to motherhood. Every fiber of your body loves being this enormously pregnant, suffused with life. The size of your prodigious womb -- it outweighs the rest of you 2:1 -- is the most erotic thing in the world to you, second only to the joy you feel when another member of your enormous harem is having their way with you. And there are so many of them, now, each attracted to your mind-boggling fertility, all pledging to help raise the children when they finally arrive.<br><br>And once they do, you know you'll just turn around and do it all again. Maybe next time you'll get even <i>bigger!</i></pink>;

    [BODY];
    [STAGE] 0;
    [status]                You're 6'3", which you admit is tall for a woman, but you feel proud of your height.;
    [short]                 tall, confident body;
    [STAGE] 1;
    [tf]                    You feel yourself shrink down a couple of inches, leaving you at an even 6 feet tall. Disappointing, but you're still taller than most people.;
    [status]                You have recently shrunk a couple of inches to an even 6 feet.;
    [short]                 pretty tall form;
    [STAGE] 2;
    [tf]                    You hear your spine grinding again, and find yourself shrinking another three inches, down to 5'9". That's still average, right?;
    [status]                You have shrunk six inches, bringing your height down to 5'9". Still respectable, but you miss towering over other people;
    [short]                 average-height body;
    [STAGE] 3;
    [tf]                    Another tingle, and you lose another three inches, shrinking to five and a half feet tall. You're definitely going to have to ask for help reaching things now.;
    [status]                You've lost nine inches from your original height, and now stand just 5'6". It's weird how much bigger everything looks from down here.;
    [short]                 short form;
    [WaitFor]               waist 3;
    [STAGE] 4;
    [tf]                    You shrink another three inches, a feeling you're quickly becoming quite used to. You're now an entire foot shorter than you were when you woke up this morning, and beginning to hope that you're not turning into a midget or something, since your $WAIST$ will make it even harder to get around now.;
    [status]                You're 5'3", a foot shorter than when you started.;
    [short]                 very short body;
    [STAGE] 5;
    [tf]                    You lose height again, this time shrinking so low you can no longer see over the podium. You guess you've lost 5 inches this time, shrinking down to a diminuitive 4'10"! Hopefully that's the last one, or you're pretty sure your $WAIST$ won't let you get around anymore!;
    [status]                You've shrunk all the way down to four feet, ten inches, almost a foot-and-a-half shorter than when the game started, and you're hoping you don't have to shrink any further.;
    [short]                 tiny, exceedingly pregnant body;
    [WaitFor]               waist 8;
     
    [BREASTS];
    [STAGE] 0;
    [status]                You like your modest, B-cup breasts. They're nice and sensitive, for one thing, and your boyfriend Cliff loves to play with your perky nipples. Your breasts are even pretty impressive in low-neck shirts, if you're wearing your nice push-up bra.;
    [short]                 modest B-cups;
    [STAGE] 1;
    [tf]                    You feel your chest grow warm and watch as your breasts swell within your $SHIRT$, pressing outward against your bra, which grows to accomodate them. A large C-cup now, you'd guess -- your boyfriend Cliff will surely enjoy this change.;
    [status]                You're a bit bigger up top than you started off as, your C-cups pressing outward against your $SHIRT$.;
    [short]                 noticible C-cups;
    [STAGE] 2;
    [tf]                    Your chest is swelling again, growing more and more prominent on your torso. This time is much more dramatic than the last, your breasts jumping forward as they fill your bra to overflowing. F-cups, probably, and quite heavy, they seem to press against your $SHIRT$, impatient to escape.;
    [status]                Your breasts are now quite large and heavy, F-cups likely to stop traffic and draw every eye in the room.;
    [short]                 huge F-cups;
    [WaitFor]               waist 2;
    [STAGE] 3;
    [tf]                    You whimper slightly as your breasts start growing again, your poor overtaxed bra finally vanishing as your breasts fill your $SHIRT$ with their voluminous flesh. You shiver as your nipples swell dramatically as well -- they feel as big as thumbs, now, and are clearly visible pressing against their fabric prisons.;
    [status]                Your huge breasts cannot be contained by a mere bra, and dominate your upper torso. They're so big that if you raise your arms they're visible from behind.;
    [short]                 enormous boobs;
    [STAGE] 4;
    [tf]                    Heat flushes through your enormous chest, but rather than growing any larger, your breasts merely grow heavier and... sloshier? Giving them a light squeeze rewards your curious hands with a squirt of liquid from your huge nipples -- you're lactating!;
    [status]                Your enormous breasts leak milk almost constantly, staining the front of your $SHIRT$.;
    [short]                 titanic, milky tits;
    [WaitFor]               waist 5;
    [STAGE] 5;
    [tf]                    Your breasts, as enormous as they are, aren't done growing yet, and as they swell to even more monsterous sizes, you can feel even more milk churning away within their enormous, watermelon-dwarfing forms. Curious, you heft one in your hands and bring the fat nipple to your lips.<br/>Instantly, milk floods your mouth, and your eyes go wide. It's delicious! You happily suckle from your incredible bounty for a minute, until the host clears his throat in annoyance and you reluctantly let the breast fall back to rest atop your $WAIST$.;
    [status]                Your breasts prevent you from sitting normally at tables, their huge bulk blocking your arms from reaching around them. Even if your arms were long enough, you'd still probably just cover whatever you were trying to do in milk, anyway, since that delicious substance is constantly spurting from your huge nipples.;
    [short]                 doorway-filling tits;
    [WaitFor]               waist 7;
    [WaitFor]               shirt 3;
     
    [WAIST];
    [STAGE] 0;
    [status]                You've always been proud of your waist, which has stayed slim and toned without a lot of effort on your part.;
    [short]                 slim, toned waist;
    [STAGE] 1;
    [tf]                    You frown as you feel your toned midsection soften and pudge outward. Oh well, more crunches after this is all over and you've won.;
    [status]                You have a little potbelly pressing against your $SHIRT$;
    [short]                 little potbelly;
    [STAGE] 2;
    [tf]                    You squirm as your belly softens again, this time the bottom pressing with some force against the tops of your $PANTS$, which you unbutton to releave some pressure. Your hand plays over the slight dome of your stomach through your $SHIRT$ as you draw it away.;
    [status]                Your belly's noticible now through your $SHIRT$, which is annoying.;
    [short]                 soft stomach;
    [WaitFor]               groin 3;
    [STAGE] 3;
    [tf]                    Your stomach swells outward. It's quite firm, you think, as you stroke it with your fingers, just like a pregnant woman's...<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Well, you hadn't been planning on having children with Cliff for a while yet, but the idea does appeal to you. You wave to him in the audience, beaming, and he smiles back, looking slightly confused by your expression.;
    [status]                You're pregnant, and it feels like a few months along, your firm belly pressing outward and down against your $PANTS$.;
    [short]                 pregnant belly;
    [WaitFor]               mind 2;
    [STAGE] 4;
    [tf]                    Your belly expands, your pregnancy progressing forward another few months. You feel a warm, mothering glow blooming in your heart, and stroke it lovingly. A little kick of the baby's foot brings a smile to your face.;
    [status]                Your growing belly brings a smile to your face, the child inside kicking against the walls of your womb on occasion.;
    [short]                 protruding belly;
    [STAGE] 5;
    [tf]                    Your gravidity has progressed in size to about as large as a full-term pregnancy. It's still sitting high on your body, though, and very wide. You're not feeling anything like labor pains yet, although the weight of your unborn child is becoming noticible.;
    [status]                Your full-term belly sits high and wide on your torso.;
    [short]                 full-term belly;
    [STAGE] 6;
    [tf]                    Your already-huge belly begins to expand again, this growth spurt noticibly longer and larger than the previous few. If you didn't know better, you'd think you had somehow stuffed a toddler in there, as opposed to the multiple unborn ones you can feel kicking away. If you were to sit down -- which is becoming more and more tempting, even if your $BUTT$ would probably require you to find a loveseat to fit into -- you're sure your belly would completely fill your lap.;
    [status]                You are hugely pregnant with a large number of children, your belly occupying your entire lap if you were to sit down.;
    [short]                 lap-filling belly;
    [WaitFor]               butt 3;
    [STAGE] 7;
    [tf]                    Your belly grows again, now obviously much wider than the rest of your $BODY$. It dominates your form, dwarfing even your $BREASTS$ and $BUTT$, and as your reach forward you realize your arms can no longer reach your extremely-stretched bellybutton. Instead, you just rub the sides of your hallway-filling form, cooing softly to your many, many unborn children.;
    [status]                Your pregnant enormity is extremely distracting, from both its size and the constant sensation of your children kicking against the walls of your womb.;
    [short]                 hallway-filling belly;
    [STAGE] 8;
    [tf]                    When you walk around the stage now, you can feel your knees tapping against the underside of your enormous belly, sending a little spasm of pleasure shooting through you each time. It's impossible for you to see anything in front of you that isn't at eye-level anymore, between your pregnancy and your $BREASTS$, which are being lifted up into your field of vision by your swollen midsection.;
    [status]                You're certain you're the most pregnant person who's ever lived, and it feels incredible.;
    [short]                 knee-knocking belly;
    [WaitFor]               butt 4;
    [STAGE] 9;
    [tf]                    Between your shrinking body and your swelling belly, you've now reached the point you've been worrying about -- your freakishly-huge belly now brushes the floor when you're standing. If you don't lean back, the friction'll drive you wild. As it is, you're walking around backward just so you can see where you're going, leaning back as far as possible to keep from dragging your womb everywhere.;
    [status]                You feel like little more than an ambulitory womb, your body dwarfed by your titanic belly.;
    [short]                 ground-scraping womb;
    [WaitFor]               body 4;
    [STAGE] 10;
    [tf]                    As your belly grows yet again, now obviously taller than your own $BODY$, you give up and stagger into a special chair the host had wheeled out. It's really more of a bed than a chair, you think as your back relaxes for the first time in what feels like months. Your belly dominates it, of course, resting in a large padded bowl, and your body sort of rests against it, supported by some other cushions, thankfully set wide enough for your $BUTT$. Your $LEGS$ naturally sort of sit wide open, presenting your $GROIN$ to the world, which makes it incredibly obvious how you managed to get yourself into this position. You wiggle your ass in the direction of Cliff and the rest of your harem in the audience, and are rewarded with a lusty cheer. You can't wait for this show to end so you can go have a nice long orgy.;
    [status]                Your belly is impossibly fertile, stuffed with innumberable children, and its sheer size leaves you endlessly aroused, even as it immobilizes you.;
    [short]                 immobilizing belly;
    [WaitFor]               mind 5;
    [WaitFor]               body 5;
     
    [BUTT];
    [STAGE] 0;
    [status]                Your skinniness means that your ass isn't anything to brag about -- it's a little bony and unimpressive.;
    [short]                 bony behind;
    [STAGE] 1;
    [tf]                    You smile as your hips and ass widen. You've always been a little self-concious about your skinny behind, and now it's at least respectable.;
    [status]                noticible;
    [short]                 average rear;
    [STAGE] 2;
    [tf]                    Your ass is growing again, passing <i>apple</i> and now closer to a proper <i>booty</i>. Your hips have spread wider as well, and between them and your $BREASTS$ you'd have quite the hourglass figure if it weren't for your $WAIST$.;
    [status]                noticible;
    [short]                 bootylicious rear;
    [WaitFor]               breasts 2;
    [WaitFor]               waist 1;
    [STAGE] 3;
    [tf]                    Your hips are grinding wider and wider, straining against the waistline of your $PANTS$. They're are far wider than your skinny shoulders, and what your mother would have euphemistly called proper 'birthing hips'. To be honest, you see where the phrase comes from -- you feel so wide down there that you could pop out a kid without a lot of strain.;
    [status]                birthing;
    [short]                 cow-like hips;
    [WaitFor]               legs 3;
    [STAGE] 4;
    [tf]                    Your hips are so wide now that the simple act of sitting down requires a lot of forethought. Most chairs, after all, are not designed with women of your incredible girth in mind. Your pelvis is at least three feed wide, a marvel of biology, and strong enough to crush any puny armrest that deigns to get in your way. Wide recliners are a tight fit, even, meaning your favorite place to rest your $BODY$ is a nice wide loveseat.;
    [status]                super-wide;
    [short]                 chair-destroying hips;
     
    [LEGS];
    [STAGE] 0;
    [status]                You have a pair of skinny, toned legs, which you keep in shape with frequent walks around the city.;
    [short]                 fit legs;
    [STAGE] 1;
    [tf]                    Your thighs expand, the gap between them vanishing as your legs bloat up.;
    [status]                Your thighs rub together as you walk.;
    [short]                 average legs;
    [STAGE] 2;
    [tf]                    Your legs grow again, this time with muscle filling in beneath the fat, forcing your stance a little wider.;
    [status]                You have thick, strong legs, capable of supporting a woman three times your size.;
    [short]                 strong, wide legs;
    [STAGE] 3;
    [tf]                    Your thighs and shins expand again, with even more fat and muscle growing on them, all the better to support your $WAIST$.;
    [status]                Your legs are powerful pistons wrapped in fat, capable of carrying your $WAIST$, although with some difficulty.;
    [short]                 ham-like thighs;
     
    [GROIN];
    [STAGE] 0;
    [status]                Your pussy is nestled between your $LEGS$, a pair of cute boyshorts wrapped around your $BUTT$ maintaining your modesty.;
    [short]                 completely average groin;
    [STAGE] 1;
    [tf]                    As you're standing on stage, you feel a sudden tingling arousal working its way through your loins. You squirm slightly. Sure, the two of you made out before you came here this morning, but that obviously wasn't enough to really get you settled for the day. Sighing, you resolve to try and concentrate on something other than the thought of his dick.;
    [status]                You feel like you want to go sneak off with your boyfriend instead of finish playing the game.;
    [short]                 damp pussy;
    [STAGE] 2;
    [tf]                    You vagina feels like you've been teasing it all day, drooling with arousal. You feel like you could fuck Cliff until he passes out and then still have enough energy left over to ream yourself with every dildo in your sex toy drawer.;
    [status]                You feel like you could spend an evening with your drawer of sex toys and still not be satiated.;
    [short]                 soaking pussy;
    [STAGE] 3;
    [tf]                    Instead of merely growing yet more aroused, this time you feel an actual physical change hit your groin. Still twitching with arousal, you peek inside your $PANTS$ to see that your previously dainy vagina has swollen into a monster, the lips as big as a man's fist. It's sticky with your own juices, and fragrant -- although it doesn't smell bad, once you think about it...;
    [status]                Your vagina is a swollen, sopping mess, incredibly aroused and distracting.;
    [short]                 aroused, puffy vagina;
    [STAGE] 4;
    [tf]                    You grind against the podium, the feeling in your $BUTT$ too strong to ignore. <i>Something</i> is happening deep within you, and it's not until the incredible wave of horniness passes that you realize your womb now feels incredible. You didn't even know you could feel something like that, to be honest, but there's no doubt in your mind that the change has supercharged your reproductive system.;
    [status]                Your fertile, overexcited womb is contributing to your skyrocketing arousal, your ovaries churning out eggs.;
    [short]                 burning-oven pussy;
    [WaitFor]               legs 2;
    [STAGE] 5;
    [tf]                    You remember that when you turned eleven, your parents took you aside and explained the birds and the bees and all that, but also told you about the chance -- and it was unlikely, they admitted -- that you had a condition known as superfertility. A few months later, your first period, a prolonged, multi-orgasmic affair, proved them right. Ever since then, you'd been very, very careful to always use as much protection as you could, because the instant some poor boy's sperm made it to your womb, <i>boom</i> pregnant. Probably multiples, the doctors also warned you, just to drive the point home.<br><br>That was why you had so enjoyed your first time with Cliff, your <b>real</b> first time, as you thought of it. Sex, up until that point, had been fun, and felt good, but getting knocked up, now that -- that felt amazing! From that moment on, you insisted -- no more condoms, no more 'ribbed for her pleasure', nothing but sperm being deposited directly into your vagina.;
    [status]                Your super-fertile womb scared you off from unprotected sex for the longest time, but now you're eager to make up for it.;
    [short]                 super-fertile womb;
    [WaitFor]               waist 6;
    [STAGE] 6;
    [tf]                    Ever since you were little, your body has been preparing for your first child. You were an early bloomer, but remained short your entire life, your body instead putting all its energy toward making sure your womb was the absolute perfect place to gestate dozens of children. Your hips were huge, your breasts voluminous, your reproductive system a finely-tuned baby-making machine.<br/><br/>Really, it was a wonder that you made it this long without getting knocked up -- you were crazy about the idea. But your parents insisted that you have a support network in place, that your fertility-goddess self would be taken care of properly when you got yourself knocked up. And, luckily for your $MIND$, you met Cliff, and then the two of your worked out a whole plan. And then -- only then -- did he finally have sex with you. The moment he deposited his sperm into your womb, your entire universe shifted. No other pleasure came close, this was your purpose, the reason for your existence. In this, you found eternal happiness.;
    [status]                Your body has been trying to get you pregnant for nearly as long as you've been alive, and now, finally, you're fulfilling your purpose to the absolute max.;

    [STAGE] 1;
    [tf]                    You find yourself wondering what it was like for your mom to raise a child. Not that you're interested in having kids anytime soon, or anything -- you and Cliff only just moved in together, after all, no need to rush into things -- but the idea sticks with you.;

    [STAGE] 2;
    [tf]                    You look down at the wedding band around your finger and smile. It was so wonderful of Cliff to propose last year. Even though the two of you had only known each other for a little while, it was obvious to everyone that you were soulmates. You were still negotiating how to best support yourselves, but you knew it was only a matter of time before you'd be able to quit your job and become a stay-at-home wife, keeping the apartment clean and making sure that Cliff always came home to a hot dinner.;

    [STAGE] 3;
    [tf]                    As your womb has expanded, so have your ambitions. You want to be a great mother and raise perfect children, kids whom other parents will look at and sigh wistfully, wishing they were their own. And a lot of kids, too -- you were raised an only child, but you don't want your kids to go though that. Luckily, Cliff is entirely on board with your desires, more than happy to be the breadwinner for your large brood.;

    [STAGE] 4;
    [tf]                    You were so happy when you and Cliff were married, and absolutely ecstatic when you found out you were pregnant. But as your incredible, obvious fertility became more and more evident, the two of you found your relationship growing... wider. More open. When Cliff suggested the two of you bring in a third, to help stablize things, you were more than happy with his pick: Laura, a gorgeous blonde bisexual woman he'd met at a corporate work retreat.<br>Laura loved your huge belly almost as much as you did, and she helped you unwind when Cliff was swamped with work. All three of you lived in the same apartment, sharing one very big bed, and you couldn't be happier. As you thought of all this, you waved at the two of them in the audience.;

    [status]                You're in a three-way relationship with your husband Cliff and a blonde bisexual woman named Laura who loves your huge belly... and you love them both.;
    [STAGE] 5;
    [tf]                    Laura suggested the next member of your growing commune, a hunky Japanese man named Hiro. And from there, the edges of your marriage began to grow ever-more ill-defined, with Laura and Cliff seeming always bringing different men and women to worship your impossible, incredible, supernaturally-fertile womb. And you made love to all of them, seemingly endlessly, your huge belly now dwarfing your own body, driving you nearly wild with arousal at all times. Each and every one of them provides you and Cliff with material support, promising to help the two of you raise your enormous family once you... eventually... give birth to all its members.;

    [tf]                    With a strange mechanical noise, a personal milking machine appears on your breasts, displacing the bikini that had been there. It sputters to life and begins sucking away at your $BREASTS$, working to keep them managibly drained.;

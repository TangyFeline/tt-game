[Desc]               <blue>Your name as Robert Scope.  You are thirty one years old and already a renowned mathematician, physicist, and engineer, but despite your fame and talents it's all starting to bore you.  Although you've never paid much attention to your looks, you are six feet tall with a black, bushy beard and muscular physique, and although you've been nominated sexiest scientist for a prestigious magazine six years in a row, you've never really found a woman who interests you.  You are here at this gameshow by virtue of an unquenchable curiosity about all this transformation thing.  Is it science or magic?  You resolve to use this experience to find out.</blue>;
[LoseDesc]               <pink>So.  You have lost this game, it seems.  Perhaps you were a little vain in thinking that it would be easy, given your natural intelligence.  Maybe your curiosity got the better of you.  You are now a six-foot tall android/sexbot with sterile white skin, your mechanical body imitating curves of a sexy woman.  With all your vibrating parts and innate programming on how to bring yourself and others to unending sexual bliss, you don't doubt much of your life will now involve being splattered with cum.  But you are still a scientist in heart and mind, and with your electronically enhanced mind and machine strength--despite all the sexy kinks--you have a renewed vigor to get back to your lab and employ all your new talents that android body can provide.</pink>;

[FACE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have a bushy black full beard that covers your upper lip, chin, and cheeks.  You don't shave often.  Every now and then it gets burned away by an experiment gone wrong, so you don't really have to.;
[short]               face with a full bushy black beard;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You stroke your chin as you feel a tingling sensation envelope your face.  You feel your beard hairs retracting back inside your cheeks.  What an odd feeling, hair growing in instead of out!;
[status]               You have a bushy black beard, although some of the hairs have retracted back into your face, leaving it a bit thinner than usual.;
[short]               face with a bushy black beard;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               More of your beard hairs retreat back inside your skin, leaving you with just a bit of stubble as if you'd shaved two or three days ago.  You can feel the breeze against your cheeks for the first time in a while.  You run your fingers over the stubble.  They don't seem as prickly as they should.;
[status]               You have a very thin black beard that makes it look as though you haven't shaved for a few days.  What hairs you have left don't feel prickly in the slightest, oddly.;
[short]               face with black facial stubble;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               The last of your beard vanishes, leaving your cheeks smooth and soft.  You can't remember having skin this smooth since before puberty.  Very fascinating.;
[status]               Your beard is entire gone, leaving you with some fairly smooth skin.;
[short]               facial-hair free face;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               The muscles in your face quiver.  You lean in toward a mirror and watch as your facial structure itself begins to change, altering your rigid jawline and sharp features into gentler and softer curves.  You feel compelled to think that you don't look much like yourself anymore, but in honestly you have barely ever spent time looking at your own reflection in the first place, so these new alterations don't really surprise you all that much.;
[status]               Your face has gone from being sharp and bearded to soft and smooth, definitely a new look for you.  Though, you admittedly never thought much of your old look one way or another.;
[short]               gentle, soft face;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               You notice a strange taste on your lips.  You take a look in the mirror and notice that your lips have turned a bit thicker and are now scarlet with lipstick.  You smack your lips a few times, trying to pick out what ingrediants might have gone into whatever product you are wearing.  You rub your lips with your $HANDS$, feeling how soft they are now.;
[status]               Your face is soft and gentle.  You also seem to be wearing lipstick on your plump, lucious lips.  It tastes a little bitter.;
[short]               gentle, soft face with scarlet lipstick;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Your eyelids quiver and you feel a tugging sensation against your eyelashes.  When you check the mirror, you see that your eyelashes have grown long and curly, painted dark with mascara.  Your cheeks also now seem to be enhanced with blush.  All in all you have a quite attractive female face.;
[status]               You have a rather attractive female face, complete with bold scarlet lipstick, long eyelashes with mascara, and blush.  Fascinating indeed!;
[short]               attractive female face with makeup;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               Your eyes begin to water.  You blink a few times and rub them with your $HANDS$.  When you look up, you notice that your vision is astonishingly crystal-clear!  Not only that, but your irises have turned an unnatural yet pretty bright pink.  You discover that you can readjust your lenses at well, providing you with telescopic and microscopic vision at your whim.  Your eyes are synthetic!  Simply astounding!;
[status]               Your have seem to be synthetic, bright pink in color with the ability to zoom in and out.  You wonder if you could remove one to study--this technology is astounding!;
[short]               attractive female face with pink synthetic eyes;
[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               Your face begins to feel stiff, making it hard for you to make any kind of expressions or even speak.  This sensation vanishes shortly as you realize you have a new set of artificial muscles to control.  Your entire face is now made out of a soft flesh-like plastic, controlled by tiny chains and levers underneath your skin.  Your skin has also lost all its color, leaving your synthetic flesh a sterile white color except for your makeup.  It's also highly sensitive to touch when you run your $HANDS$ over it.  Fascinating!;
[status]               Your face is entirely synthetic, seemingly made out of a soft and flexible plastic that resembles human skin.  It is a pale white in color except for the lipstick, mascara, and blush that you are wearing.  Fascinating!;
[short]               synthetic pale face with makeup;

[VOICE];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your voice is a deep masculine rumble.  Sometimes you've had female--and some male--interns get lost with a dreamy expression on their faces when you speak for an hour straight during a lecture.;
[short]               deep masculine voice;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               As you reflect out loud as to how you lost that last round, your voice slides up an octave, leaving you with more of a normal baritone sound to your voice.  You hum and sing 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' with your $HANDS$ against your throat, observing how your vocal cords vibrate a bit differently.  Fascinating!;
[status]               Your voice has risen from a deep masculine rumble to a more normal baritone.;
[short]               average baritone voice;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You are trying to point out a fallacy in the last round when your voice cracks, leaving you unable to speak for a few seconds.  When your voice returns, you speak in a tenor pitch.  This will certainly take some getting used to, but you adapt to new truths and facts rather quickly and before long you don't even notice it anymore.;
[status]               Your voice has risen again, leaving you speaking in a tenor pitch.;
[short]               tenor voice;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You feel a swelling tighten up your throat.  You clear your throat, hearing your voice rise even higher to become a singsongy feminine alto.  Quite interesting, hearing the opposite gender's voice coming from your own throat.;
[status]               Your voice has risen to a singsongly feminine alto.;
[short]               singsony alto voice;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You feel the back of your mouth tingle and struggle to breath for a few moments.  You panic slightly for a bit before you realize that you don't even need to breath anymore.  'Huh,' you comment.  Your voice sounds electronic, as if your voice were being filtered slightly by a vocoder.;
[status]               Your voice has become a slightly buzzy, computerized feminine alto.  You no longer need to breath, so you must be getting oxygen from elsewhere.  Or maybe your body no longer needs it at all.;
[short]               slightly computerized alto voice;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               The level of electronic distortion in your voice increases.  Not only that, but you speak in a slightly erratic fashion with some strange pauses and pronunciations.  Presumably whatever speech software you are running is either a bit crude or intentionally 'retro' sounding.  Either way, you don't really mind.;
[status]               Your voice is a feminine alto that is heavily computerized--fully synthesized, it seems.;
[short]               heavily computerized alto voice;

[PANTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You are wearing an old pair of jeans around your $BUTT$ and $LEGS$.  It is scorched with all sorts of burns and dotted with stains.  As a general rule, don't wear good pants good pants to any laboratories.  You've adopted that as a bit of a life philosophy too.;
[short]               beat up old pair of jeans;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               The blue coloring of your jeans seems to dissipate, leaving the material a pale white.  It also feels a good deal thinner, the stitching less coarse.  You may need to buy a new pair--this pair of jeans has saved your $LEGS$ from the worst of acid spills countless times by now.;
[status]               You are wearing an old pair of jeans around your $BUTT$ and $LEGS$.  Most of the blue coloring has faded away and the material is a good deal thinner than you remember.;
[short]               thin pair of pale jeans;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your jeans shrink, the material around your ankles stretching up to about your mid calves like a pair of capris.  Yes, you certainly should invest in a new pair once this show is over.;
[status]               You are wearing an old pair of jeans around your $BUTT$ and $LEGS$.  The fabric is thin and pale and they only reach down to your mid calves, sort of like a pair of capris.;
[short]               thin pair of pale capris;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               The fabric of your capri-like jeans grows thinner and becomes translucent, revealing the form of your $LEGS$ and $BUTT$.  It flutters a bit in the breeze.  All of the stains and burns are gone, making it look factory fresh.;
[status]               You are wearing a translucent, thin pair of white capris that reveal the dark outlines of your $LEGS$ and $BUTT$.;
[short]               translucent white capris;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You feel a draft against your $LEGS$ as your capris shorten to your knees.  The fabric is silk-thin and equally soft, pretty much the exact opposite of what a professional should wear in the lab.  With the slightest blush you realize that the fabric even shows off the form of your $GROIN$.  The last time a peer saw that region of your body she... well, you two actually ended up sleeping together later that night, but you know you should feel embarassed now.;
[status]               You are wearing a pair of silk-thin and soft capris that only extend down to your knees.  Your $GROIN$ is partially visible through the fabric.;
[short]               silky, transclucent knee-length capris;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Small ribbons of your capris flutter to the ground as the fabric creates two distinct leg holes, leaving you wearing something much more akin to a skirt.  It even pulls up higher against your legs, coming up to your mid thighs to reveal almost all of your $LEGS$.  At least the fabric grows multiple players, obscuring your $GROIN$ a bit more than before.;
[status]               You are wearing a white silk skirt that reaches to your thighs, revealing almost all of your $LEGS$.  At least the fabric has multiple layers, obscuring your $GROIN$ a bit better.;
[short]               white silk skirt;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               You skirt becomes thicker and fluffier, very light and breezy.  On the downside, it shrinks even more so that it reveals the bottom of your $BUTT$ as well as your $GROIN$ if you raise either one of your $LEGS$ too high.  It's at least amazingly soft and comfortable... sexy, you even dare to say.;
[status]               You have a fluffy white skirt wrapped around your hips, showing off your $BUTT$ and even your $GROIN$ if you raise one of your $LEGS$ too high.;
[short]               fluffy, white silk miniskirt;

[FEET];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your feet are thick and broad, eleven inches long with the top covered in dark hairs.  They are a bit pale since you almost never remove them from your $SHOES$.;
[short]               hairy, broad feet;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your feet shrink from eleven inches down to only seven.  The hairs on the top of your feet are also gone, leaving your foot smooth and pale with short dainty toes--somewhat womanly.  You aren't sure what the long term effects of small feet mean in the laboratory, but you'll have to look into buying a new pair of work shoes even if it means poking around in the womens' department.;
[status]               Your feet are seven inches long, short, pale, and smooth with dainty toes.;
[short]               hairless, dainty feet;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You bend down and clutch your feet in your $HANDS$ as you feel your toes begin to merge together into a single blocky digit with two mechanical joints.  Your skin also feels tough and rubbery.  You envision some numbers spinning as you take a few cautious step, the number rising and falling as sensors underneath your skin measure the relative pressure against the palms of your feet.  Somehow you don't think that these feet were meant to be kept underneath shoes--they certainly don't need the protection, at any rate.;
[status]               Your feet are seven inches long and made out of a white rubbery plastic.  Your toes are all merged together into a double-jointed block that resembles the human foot in general shape but functions robotically.;
[short]               robotic, plastic white feet;

[WAIST];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have a fairly broad and masculine waist, not particularly muscular but nicely toned.  It fits comfortably under your $SHIRT$.;
[short]               masculine, broad waist;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your feel your sides burn a little as your waist grows a bit more slender, forming more of an accentuated curve from from your hip up to your shoulder underneath your $SHIRT$.  You stretch your back, discovering that you seem a little more flexible.;
[status]               You have a slightly narrow waist that accentuates the curve running up from your hip to your shoulder underneath your $SHIRT$.;
[short]               slightly narrow waist;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You wince, clutching your $ARMS$ to your sides as your wide contracts a little more, leaving you with a somewhat feminine tucked in waist.  Even the little bulge of your stomach seems to be smoothly flat against your curves.  When the transformation subsides, you find that it's rather easy to rest your $HANDS$ on your hips.;
[status]               You have a feminine, narrow waist and flat stomach that accentuates the curve running up from your hip to your shoulder underneath your $SHIRT$.;
[short]               feminine narrow waist;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You feel a tingling just above your $GROIN$, but the feeling is very concentrated.  You feel around underneath your $SHIRT$, discovering a distinct crease just above your pelvis.  You rotate your hips and waist.  It seems as though you now have a distinctively separate torso and $LEGS$, held together mechanically by machine joints.  You aren't very flexible in this state, only able to lean forward, backward, or to the sides before reaching the limits of your movement.;
[status]               You have a distinctive gap between your torso and $LEGS$, two different parts connected internally by machine joints that several limit your movement.;
[short]               mechanical, feminine waist;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You breathe a sigh of relief as several more creases form around your waist, evenly spaced from your $GROIN$ up to your belly button like the joints on a suit of armor.  Each individual joint offers enough flexibility that you can bend down and touch your $FEET$ with ease--not only forward but backward as well, flexible as an acrobat!  You are immediately rather fond of this aspect of your transformation.;
[status]               You have several scale-like joints along your feminine waist, allowing you to stretch with astounding flexibility and ease underneath your $SHIRT$.;
[short]               flexible, plated wasplike waist;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               The skin up and down your waist turns plastic and white, extremely tough to protect your internal organs and machinery.  Small pink plastic folds form between the gaps of your scale plates, dispelling some of the skeletal look about your form where your $SHIRT$ was getting pinched by your joints.;
[status]               You have several scale-like joints along your tough white plastic feminine waist, allowing you to stretch with astounding flexibility and ease underneath your $SHIRT$.;
[short]               plastic, flexible feminine waist;

[ACCESSORY];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You are wearing a small digital wristwatch.;
[short]               ;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You feel a sharp itching as something seems rectangular seems to poke up through your upper $BREASTS$ just below your neck.  You look down to see that a small electronic interface is now fused against your body, sporting a small digital display and several dozen glowing buttons.  You notice a small white tab, a plastic covering that you slide over to hide the panel.  You feel tempted to poke a few buttons to see what happens but decide to wait for later.;
[status]               You have a small rectangular interface above your $BREASTS$ and below your neck.  You've extended a white panel over it for now.;
[short]               rectangular white panel;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               A series of black squares contained within a larger square appear on the right side of your neck.  You recognize it as a bar code, marking you with an easily scannable digital signature just like items in a grocery store.;
[status]               You have a series of black squares contained within a larger square appear on the right side of your neck.  You recognize it as a bar code, marking you with an easily scannable digital signature just like items in a grocery store.;
[short]               bar code;

[HANDS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               Your hands are tough and broad, your fingers wide and stubby.  Your skin is discolored in patches from various chemical burns.  Despite their size and exposure to danger, you still have a decent amount of dexterity with them.;
[short]               thick, manly hands;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your fingers begin to tingle pins-and-needles style.  You shake them and tap them against your $BREASTS$ to regain sensation.  When you sensation finally subsides you notice that your hands have shrunk about an inch and a half, your skin not particularly soft but a far cry from your normal burns and calluses.  It feels as though your grip has weakened considerably, but on the plus side your fingers are much more slender and steady, better for precision lab work.;
[status]               Your hands have shrunken a good deal, your skin neither soft nor tough.  Your grip is weaker, but your petite fingers are better suited for precision lab work.;
[short]               small, average hands;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               The skin around your fingers and hands grow moist and smooth as if you regularly conditioned them.  Your nails are clean and pure, expertly trimmed.  They look and feel extremely feminine.  Your fingertips feel light and soft against your $FACE$ and $HAIR$.  A few days in the lab and they won't look anywhere near as pristine as this, so you decide you might as well try and enjoy it while it lasts.;
[status]               Your hands are small, pale and delicate, the skin moisturized and baby-soft.  They look as if you've never worked a day of hard labor before in your life, which in a sense is rather nice since it certainly won't last.;
[short]               delicate, feminine hands with baby-soft skin;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your fingers grow stiff and insensitive.  You flex them, trying to fight back the sensation, but you realize that your flesh itself is turning into a ceramic-tough white material, each digit encased in powerful plates.  Gaps form around around your joints, permitting back some basic dexterity.  You look closely through the gaps and see bundles of wires running through your mechanical skeleton.  Better not prod too deep.;
[status]               Your hands are made out of a tough white ceramic, each digit encased in plating that cover up a metal subskeleton and wiring.;
[short]               ceramic-plated mechanical hands;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You feel your fingertips tingle as a translucent white rubber covering hides the gaps between your joints, giving more of a normal human look despite their sterile white color.  Your dexterity also improves--you flick each finger separately and discover you can manipulate them with far greater speed, strength, and precision.  The calculations for this kind of movement are immense, but it's nothing your $MIND$ can't handle.;
[status]               Your hands are fully mechanical, each surface covered up by strong ceramic plates and coated by a translucent rubber that hides the gaps around the joints.  They are astoundingly dexterous and precise, far more than any human.;
[short]               highly dexterous robotic hands;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Your fingertips begin to vibrate, an ability you have no idea why anyone would engineer into your robotic hands.  That is, until you touch your vibrating fingertips to your $BREASTS$ and $GROIN$ when it dawns on you that the vibrating function is probably meant to act as a sexual stimulant, wrapped around man's cock or circling around a clit.  You're oddly eager to find some lucky man or woman to practice using them on...;
[status]               our hands are fully mechanical, each surface covered up by strong ceramic plates and coated by a translucent rubber that hides the gaps around the joints.  Your fingertips vibrate at will, probably meant for sexual foreplay.;
[short]               highly dexterous, vibrating robotic hands;

[BREASTS];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have a somewhat muscular and extremely hairy chest.  It's not as though you ever work out, but sometimes there is heavy lab equipment to move around and you aren't patient enough to call and wait for interns, technicians, or janitors to do the task for you.;
[short]               hairy, muscular chest;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You feel a tingling around your upper chest.  You pat your chest with your $HANDS$ to try and figure out what is going on.  You don't notice much except that your pectoral muscles seem to have swollen a tiny bit, leaving two miniscule humps underneath your $SHIRT$.  Interesting.;
[status]               You have a somewhat muscular and hairy chest.  You do seem to have a slight bit of swelling of your pectoral muscles that leave tiny mounds below your $SHIRT$, but it's not really noticeable.;
[short]               hairy, muscular chest with slightly swollen pecs;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               The tingling sensation returns to your upper torso.  This time for sure you notice that your pectoral muscles have swollen again.  You pat and cup them in your $HANDS$.  There does not seem to much muscular density left to them.  Rather, they just seem fatty.  Hmmmm.  You suspect you might know where this is going, but not all the evidence is in yet.;
[status]               You have a somewhat muscular and hairy chest, although your pectoral muscles have swollen a good deal and seem to consist more of fat than muscle.;
[short]               hairy, muscular chest with fatty pecs;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Many of the muscles on your chest seem to be absorbed back into your body, not to mention a decent percentage of your chest hair.  You don't mind.  Easy come, easy go.;
[status]               You have a fairly average chest, although your pectoral muscles muscles have swollen a good deal and seem to consist more of fat than muscle.;
[short]               slightly hairy average chest with fatty pecs;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Your pecs inflate again underneath your $SHIRT$.  When you touch them with your $HANDS$, you feel a bit of a jiggling motion as the flesh in the area squishes between your fingers.  It is fairly evident that you now seem to have small but clearly feminine breasts.  Fascinating.  You should jot down your psychological experiences for future study.;
[status]               You have a fairly average, slightly hair chest.  Quite interestingly, however, you seem to have a pair of small mammary glands--female breasts.;
[short]               slightly hair average chest with small breasts;
[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               The last of your chest hairs retreat back inside your skin or flutter to the ground, leaving your chest entirely smooth.  It's a rather unique feeling sensing your $SHIRT$ against your now soft skin.  You also notice that your enlarged nipples are far more sensitive to contact now, growing erect to repeated contact to nearby fabric.;
[status]               You have a fully hairless chest as well as a small pair of female breasts.  Your enlarged nipples are also quite sensitive to the touch.;
[short]               hairless chest with small breasts;
[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Your breasts grow another cup in size, perhaps a B cup, leaving quite distinct mounds underneath your $SHIRT$.  Although you will freely admit that you are about the last person to consult with regards to female fashion.  You'd rather know the volume of your breasts in cubic centimeters and define their proportions using bezier curves than some silly arbitrary letter designation.;
[status]               You have a fully hairless chest with a pair of what you'd estimate to be B cup breasts.;
[short]               hairless chest with B-cup breasts;
[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               Your skin around your chest begins to feel odd.  For a moment it seems to feel rigid and stiff, almost completely numb to the touch when you rub it with your $HANDS$.  It feels rather rubbery and artificial.  Not only that, but its peach pigment is starting to vanish, leaving the skin a pale white that matches the color of your $SHIRT$ and $PANTS$.;
[status]               You have a hairless female torso with B-cup breasts.  Oddly, your skin seems rubbery and is losing its pigment.;

[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               The last of the peach pigment on your skin vanishes, leaving your rubbery, artificial skin a pale, sterile white.  You rub it with your $HANDS$, discovering that you are once again sensitive to touch in an odd digital sort of fashion.  Interestingly, your breasts are also much firmer now.  You can retract your rubber nipples at will now, and when you touch them they activate a stream of sexual ecstasy straight into your brain that also makes your $GROIN$ steamy.  Your chest is entirely synthetic.  Fascinating!;
[status]               Your have an entirely artificial pale female torso with firm B-cup breasts.  You can retract your nipples at will, and a firm poke by your $HANDS$ sends you almost immediately into induced orgasm.;

[STAGE] 9;
[tf]               Your chest begins to glow just underneath your artificial B-cup breasts.  You clench your teeth as your internal organs--however many of them remain human--reshape and vanish, leaving you with guts of wires, circuits, and processors powered by a small fusion reactor.  Simply amazing!  You have become a android shaped like a woman!  You can't wait to get your $HANDS$ into your insides for some study.;
[status]               Your have an entirely artificial pale female torso with firm B-cup breasts.  You can retract your nipples at will, and a firm poke by your $HANDS$ sends you almost immediately into induced orgasm.

[short]               hairy, broad arms;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               The toned muscles on your arm vanish, leaving them fairly slender from your shoulder to your $HANDS$.  Most of your arm hairs are also gone.  You hope it doesn't impede with your lab work too much, but at worst you'll have to call in some extra help to move some of the heavier equipment, nothing too major.;
[status]               Your arms are mostly hairless and a bit slender, lacking your normal toned muscles.;
[short]               slender, mostly hairless arms;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               The last of your arm hairs vanish, leaving your skin smooth and bare... rather womanly, even though you typically can't see much above your wrists due to the sleeves on your $SHIRT$.  You ponder joining a gym just to help get some of your former strength back but decide against it--you'll let your muscles build back up naturally like before.  No big deal.;
[status]               Your arms and slender and entirely hairless, the skin soft and pure.  A few weeks in the lab and maybe you'll at least have some of your muscle back, though they'll still probably look pretty girly.;
[short]               slender, feminine arms;
[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               The skin on your arms turns pale and waxlike, providing a slight gleam.  There is a clear partition at your elbow where a mechanical joint has replaced your elbow, though some soft rubbery padding provides protection from anything getting pinched between the gap.  Although you don't have any visible muscle in your feminine-resembling arms, you discover that you are no weaker than before--you're actually a good deal stronger, in fact!;
[status]               Your arms are slender and made out of a white, waxy plastic.  They are robotic and deceivingly strong, despite resembling the arms of a petite woman.;

[short]               hairy, toned legs;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your legs feel weaker and quiver as an icy pulse rises along them, running up from your $FEET$ to your $GROIN$.  You feel your thighs and calves thicken a bit while other parts grow softer and more slender.  All over you seem to have fewer hairs.  You don't take much notice.;
[status]               Your legs are somewhat smooth and soft, proportioned a little womanly but still featuring a masculine amount of coarse dark hairs.;
[short]               slightly hairy legs;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You squeak a little in your $VOICE$ as another jolt passes through your legs.  You stumble a little as the last of your leg hairs vanish, leaving your legs curvy and feminine underneath your $PANTS$.  Other than the fact your thighs brush against each other a bit more, you don't notice the change much.;
[status]               Your legs are smooth, curvy and feminine.  As strange as it is to look like a woman below your $GROIN$, you don't notice it much.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You stumble, hanging onto your podium with your $ARMS$ and $HANDS$ as the sense of touch in your feminine legs vanish, leaving you unable to balance.  Your skin turns a pale, plastic white, shining dully in the light.  You teeter about uncomfortably, hoping you won't be stuck this way for long.  Having good balance is rather important in a lab full of volatile chemicals and expensive machinery.;
[status]               Your legs are curvy and feminine, your skin turned in a white plastic that is almost wholly insensitive to touch.;
[short]               plastic, white feminine legs;
[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Several seams appear above and below your knees, recreating the hinge of a normal human knee.  You are thankful as the feeling in your legs return, but instead of a normal sensation of touch you are able to calculate the precise numbers to steady your upright stance.  You take a few steps forward and discover that you walk in a mechanical manner though with algorithmic smoothness.;
[status]               Your legs are curvy and feminine, your skin made out of a tough yet flexible plastic underneath your $PANTS$.  There are two seams above and below your knees, providing the hinge-like flexibility of a knee.;

[BUTT];
[STAGE] 0;
[status]               You have a fairly uninteresting, slightly hairy masculine ass underneath your $PANTS$.  You've received some compliments regarding the sexiness of your bum from some women over the years, but generally it holds little interest to you.;
[short]               slightly hairy masculine ass;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You squeeze your $LEGS$ together as you feel two sharp jabs emanating from the sides of your hips.  You squirm in discomfort as your hips widen a bit and your ass swells a little, forming slightly more of a bulge against your $PANTS$.;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You feel the fabric of your $PANTS$ tighten as your hips and ass grow out another few steps, leaving you with a pair of perky, round ass cheeks and somewhat sensual curves running from your $LEGS$, hips, and $WAIST$.  You examine your ass in the mirror and realize that it's looking a bit girly.  Walking feels a bit different with your new proportions.  Interesting.;
[status]               You have a somewhat feminine, perky ass under your with wide hips that forms one long sensual contour along your upper $LEGS$, hips, and $WAIST$.  Your hips sway slightly when you walk.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               Your hips and ass inflate one last time, forming a rather sexy teardrop-shaped bulge under your $PANTS$.  You unconsciously gyrate your hips with every step, swaying them seductively.  You try to focus on your walking rhythm to minimize its sluttiness, but the movement almost seems hard-coded into your brain and takes too much effort to fight against.  This ass was designed to entice... and the thought of it makes your $GROIN$ stir.;
[status]               You have a very feminine teardrop shaped ass bulging under your $PANTS$.  You walk with a very deliberate swap that seems meant to induce sexual desire.;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               Your ass tingles as your skin grows thicker and rubbery, human flesh replaced by a similar plastic counterpart that still retains some, but not all, of its softness.  The material is shiny and sleek, slippery to the touch of your $HANDS$.  With a bit of surprise you realize that you can sway and jiggle your ass to a perfect rythem, ideal for grinding up against a man or woman's crotch.  The thought makes your $GROIN$ stir and brings an anticipatory moan to your $VOICE$.  This robotic ass is meant to seduce and pleasure.;
[status]               You have a feminine ass made out of a firm rubbery plastic, hips wide and cheeks large and firm under your $PANTS$.  You can sway it with a sexy rythem that comes naturally.  Not only that but you can set it vibrating with a mere thought.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You grow aware of all the minute processes your body must perform to maintain its daily routine--the flowing of blood, beating of your heart, filter of your liver--as well as the operations of small mechanical and electronic components embedded among them underneath your $BREASTS$ and $WAIST$.  You can even manipulate them at your own risk, but it's best to just let your operating system take care of details at that level.;
[status]               Your mind is brilliant.  You can recall information faster, can pick out equations from the world around you, and are aware of all the processes going on inside your body underneath your $BREASTS$ and $WAIST$.;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               You are suddenly aware of the movement of every signal, every electrical pulse, every inner function of your body.  You see the studio and world in general as a series of calculations, some predictable, some with infinite large variations beyond your computer power.  At the same time, you still have your old human, scientific mind able to see the beauty in the world as well.  You have the mind of an android!;

[GROIN];
[STAGE] 0;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               You wince a little bit as you feel a tugging sensation against your penis and testicles as they seem to shrivel up a size.  You slip one of your $HANDS$ down into your $PANTS$ and probe around.  You don't seem quite as well endowed anymore.  Oh well.  You don't really have time for sex anyway.;
[status]               You have a masculine pelvis with a smaller six-inch cock below bushy black pubic hair.;
[short]               6-inch cock with black pubic hair;
[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               You feel your groin begin to stir again.  This time after you probe around with your $HANDS$ underneath your $PANTS$, you discover that your manhood has shrunk down to a rather unimpressive three inches and your testicles seem to ride fairly high up in your body.  Oh well.  Sex is overrated, especially when there is so much science to be done!;
[status]               You have a masculine pelvis with a puny three-inch cock below bushy black pubic hair.;

[tf]               The public hair enveloping your 3-inch cock pulls back into your skin, leaving your crotch entirely smooth and shaven below your $PANTS$, just enough for your $HANDS$ to discover that you don't seem to have any genitalia left whatsoever.You feel an all new sensation as a small portion of skin between your legs stretches inside your body, leaving a small damp slit.  You may not have enjoyed many carnal pleasures in your life but you clearly recognize that you now seem to have a psuedo-vagina.  You probe around with your $HANDS$, discovering that you lack a clitoris or labia for the time being.  You wonder how you are able to use the bathroom in this state, but luckily you don't need to find out right now.;

[tf]               You gasp a little in your $VOICE$ as your psuedo-vagina begins to extend wider toward your anus.  Not only that, but some new sensitive folds of skin begin to blossom out.  There you, now you have a clitoris and labia like a genuine woman.  You wonder how deep the transformation goes--do you have a womb now?  Sadly you lack the time to find out.  For now, anyway.;
[status]               You have a genuine female vagina for your once-male crotch, complete with a sensitive clitoris and labia that dribble juices if you stimulate them too much with your $HANDS$.;

[STAGE] 6;
[tf]               Your vagina begins to tingle and feels as if it's heating up a dozen extra degrees celcius.  You are feeling... amazingly horny.  The slightest touch with your $HANDS$ nearly makes you collapse to the knees on your $LEGS$ in ecstasy.  You decide to investigate this later so as not to distracted, even though you already sport a damp spot on your $PANTS$.;

[STAGE] 7;
[tf]               You clutch your $LEGS$ together as a trembling sensation bounces between your thighs.  You gasp in your $VOICE$, eyes wide.  When the pleasureable feeling passes, you notice that your vagina feels a bit rubbery and your cum has an odd cherry scent to it.  You aren't quite sure what to make of this.  Only time will tell, you suppose.;

[STAGE] 8;
[tf]               You tense up as your vagina narrows again, the fingers on your $HANDS$ feeling a lubricated rubbery material instead of human skin.  You inquisitively slip the right index fingers of your $HANDS$ around your vagina, but the moment you make contact you your clitoris you flip a switch and gasp in your $VOICE$ as an orgasm overtakes you.  You feel your crotch mechanically vibrating, inducing an unending orgasm that lasts until you turn your clitoris-switch back off.  You seem to have the vagina of a robot designed for sex--a sexbot!  As much as you dislike the idea of such advanced technology being used for something so silly as fucking, you do have a growing itch to  bring orgasms to a lucky man or woman.;
[status]               You have the genitalia of a rather advanced sexbot, a tight, vibrating rubber vagina that can be electronically brought to orgasm simply by flicking a switch that resembles a clitoris.  It drips a milky cherry-scented fluid that dampens your $PANTS$ and trickles down your $LEGS$.;

[HAIR];
[STAGE] 0;

[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your hairline recedes an inch and a half, leaving you with a smooth and oddly wrinkle-free forehead.  You comb your $HANDS$ through your hair, pulling out several large clumps.  Hm.  Well, you were overdue to lose your hair to some terrible experiment sooner or later anyway.;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               More of your hair falls out, leaving the top of your scalp with only a small layer of scraggly black hairs.  You can feel the breeze against your scalp for the first time in living memory.  Oh well.  You can just wear a hat to keep warm.;

[status]               You are wearing a long, loose white lab coat that is adorned with fire and acid burns, food and chemical stains, rips, and even a few speckles of blood from some of your more dangerous experiments.  It extends down to your knees.  You typically feel naked without it.;
[short]               long, white, and beaten-up lab coat;
[STAGE] 1;
[tf]               Your lab coat, normally fairly loose around your body, shrinks a bit  around your shoulders, $ARMS$, and $BREASTS$.  It also seems to be a bit shorter, only reaching down to your thighs instead of your knees.  Interesting.;

[STAGE] 2;
[tf]               Your lab coat tightens around your body again, not exactly skintight but tight enough that you think you might have some trouble getting it off again.  Most of the burns and tears seem to have healed themselves, only a few remaining dark blots showing that the coat has been through years of use.;

[STAGE] 3;
[tf]               You take a gulp as your lab coat tightens around you again, the fabric squeezing against your $BREASTS$, $WAIST$, and $BUTT$.  You pull at it with your $HANDS$ with absolutely no idea how you are supposed to get this thing off without a pair of scissors or scalpel.  The fabric now seems bleached a pure white, no evidence of wear or tear anywhere.;
[status]               You are wearing a very tight white lab coat that squeezes tightly against your body.  You have to tug at its collar with your $HANDS$ to keep it from choking you, or at least giving the sensation of such.;

[STAGE] 4;
[tf]               All of a sudden you notice the scent of latex drifting up to your nose.  When you look down, you notice that your previously cotton lab coat is now an extremely tight, shiny white latex catsuit that reveals every curve on your $BREASTS$, $WAIST$, and $BUTT$.  You even squeak a little bit when you move around.  Oddly, you don't feel constricted by it anymore, and it doesn't take long to get used to movement in it.  It's even a bit comfortable.;

[STAGE] 5;
[tf]               Small sky-blue lines begin to loop around your shiny, white latex catsuit, forming some rather intricate patterns that somewhat resemble a circuitboard.  Indeed, they seem to coarse with tiny beads of electricity.  At first you suspect that it is purely aesthetic, but you begin to notice that there actually is fluid running through them, absorbing the heat emanating from your $BREASTS$ and skin.;
[status]               You are a wearing an extremely tight, shiny white latex catsuit that shows off every curve of your $BREASTS$, $WAIST$, and $BUTT$.  It is interlaced with a series of blue veins that act as coolant circulating around your body.;

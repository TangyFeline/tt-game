<TFMessage_20_Percent_1st>Your opponent's spell managed to graze you. For a small moment you are very happy that your attacker didn't hit you directly. But something is off. You shouldn't be that happy. With ease you dispel the weak mind enchantment.</TFMessage_20_Percent_1st>

<TFMessage_40_Percent_1st>Your opponent's spell managed to hit you at the Ankle. You smile that somehow nothing bad happened to you. But something is off. You shouldn't be that happy. It takes a moment but you dispel the mind enchantment.</TFMessage_40_Percent_1st>

<TFMessage_60_Percent_1st>Your opponent's spell managed to hit you on your shoulder. The spell looked really beautiful flying towards you. No wonder you couldn't evade in time. Wrapping your platinum blond hairs around your finger you try figuring out what was done to you. You look down your body but nothing seems to be wrong. As you blow a bubble with your bubblegum and let it explode you suddenly know. It makes you a little bit sad but you dispel the enchantment on your mind and body, returning your hair to the normal color.</TFMessage_60_Percent_1st>

<TFMessage_80_Percent_1st>Your opponent's spell managed to hit you on your shoulder. The spell looked really beautiful flying towards you. Did you even try to evade? Wrapping your platinum blond hairs around your finger you try figuring out what was done to you. You look down your body but nothing seems to be wrong. Small but firm breasts.  Well toned legs. Everything seems just fine. As you blow a bubble with your bubblegum and let it explode you suddenly know. It makes you a little bit sad but you dispel the enchantment on your mind and body, returning your hair to the normal color. Changing back this lean body for your old one.</TFMessage_80_Percent_1st>

<TFMessage_100_Percent_1st>Your opponent's spell managed to hit you square on the chest. Nearly knocking you over. Lose strands of platinum blond hair sway in your view. You cant fight like this! You search for a nearby mirrored surface to view the damage done to your hair. For a moment you are stunned by the lean and athletic body of yours. You smile when you see those perky breasts of yours but frown at the disarray of your hair.  Just when you want to tie them up so they don't hinder you in practice you remember that this is all wrong.  It makes you sad but you dispel the enchantment on your mind and body, returning your hair to the normal color. Changing back this lean body for your old one.</TFMessage_100_Percent_1st>

<TFMessage_Completed_1st>Your opponent's spell managed to hit you square on the chest. Knocking you over. How embarrassing. Hopefully nobody from your cheer-squad did see you. You quickly get back up and search for a mirrored surface to check on yourself. Your lean and athletic body of yours seems to be fine. Long toned legs and perky breasts that make all the other girls jealous. Platinum blond hair tied up in a ponytail. Everything seems to be just fine but you could swear there is something you did forget. You murmur a "what ever" and unpack a bubblegum. "Time to go to practice. Don't wanna be late" you think just when you burst your first bubble.</TFMessage_Completed_1st>

<TFMessage_20_Percent_3rd>You only manage to graze your opponent. For a short moment your target shows a silly smile but then frowns and dispels your spell.</TFMessage_20_Percent_3rd>

<TFMessage_40_Percent_3rd>You only manage to graze your opponent at the Ankle. Your target rubs their leg and brightly smiles that your spell seemingly has no effect. It's your turn to smile when your targets face shows signs of a small shock. Moments later your spell is dispelled.
</TFMessage_40_Percent_3rd>

<TFMessage_60_Percent_3rd>You hit your opponent on the shoulder. It amuses you how your confused target doesn't notice that their hair turns platinum blond and cascades now over their shoulder. Playing with a loose strand of hair and chewing bubblegum. Suddenly your target frowns and dispels your enchantment.</TFMessage_60_Percent_3rd>

<TFMessage_80_Percent_3rd>You hit your opponent on the shoulder. It amuses you how your confused target doesn't notice that their hair turns platinum blond and cascades now over their shoulder. You watch your target checking out their own body. Somehow not noticing that their body is a lot younger, leaner and more athletic.  A body of a fit young adult woman. Suddenly your target frowns and dispels your enchantment. You still didn't win but you are getting closer.</TFMessage_80_Percent_3rd>

<TFMessage_100_Percent_3rd>You hit your opponent square on the chest. As their stands wavers your target doesn't notice that their hair turns platinum blond and cascades now over their shoulder. Irritated by stray hairs your target seems to look for a mirror, completely ignoring you. Suddenly your opponent stops in their track and shoots you an annoyed stare. Your target dispels your enchantment just in time to prevent turning into athletic 19 year old girl. You bite back a curse knowing that you are this close to winning.</TFMessage_100_Percent_3rd>

<TFMessage_Completed_3rd>You hit your opponent square on the chest knocking them to their feet. Bracing yourself for the revenge spell you are surprised that your target completely ignores you. Mesmerized you watch as your target is searching for something. Ignoring that their hair turns platinum blond and binds itself to a high ponytail. Their body becomes leaner and more athletic before your very eyes. You are nearly lost in the curves of those perky breasts and toned legs that you nearly miss when your target rushes out. With a smile you follow your victim. A 19 year old cheerleader.</TFMessage_Completed_3rd>

<TFMessage_20_Percent_1st>Your attacker casts a spell, but it clearly failed as your stomach simply growls.</TFMessage_20_Percent_1st>

<TFMessage_40_Percent_1st>Once again, your attacker casts a spell at you. This time, you feel a tiny pinch all around your waist. You look down an notice a thin layer of white laces pouring out. You fiddle with it a little bit, and then snap your fingers to make it disappear. You can't help but giggle doing so.</TFMessage_40_Percent_1st>

<TFMessage_60_Percent_1st>Your opponent keeps harassing you with this weird spell creating laces around you. Now, many more thin layers of white laces flow from your waist and form a small white tutu. You can't resist fluffing it and let out a giggle, suddenly feeling all girly. You even make a little spin, like a ballerina. As inoffensive as this spell may be, you cast a counterspell and make the tutu vanish.</TFMessage_60_Percent_1st>

<TFMessage_80_Percent_1st>This time, your body is surrounded by a whitish aura. You look down at the white tutu forming around your waist and sink your hands into the delicate lace. The more you fluff it, the more it thickens and lengthens, forming a petticoat. You feel like your mind is also being fluffed and you can't stop looking dazedly at the lace surrounding you. You snap out of your trance as you have a weird feeling the world is growing around you, but a quick look around is all you need to realize your lower body has in fact totally melted into the ground. Panicked, you quickly shout another counterspell and revert to normal on the floor. As you stand up, you hope your mind still have enough strength to resist another attack of your opponent.</TFMessage_80_Percent_1st>

<TFMessage_100_Percent_1st>Your opponent channels all of their energy to finish your transformation. Totally blinded by a white aura, you feel the petticoat pushing against your arms, dead by your side. This time, your mind is literally overwhelmed by thoughts of twirling, dancing and frolicking around. You are submerged by joyfulness, hoping you'll make someone look undoubtedly girly with all your frills. You giggle as you think of girls flashing their panties around town at the sightliest bend. By miracle, you regain control of your mind as something tickles your face. Opening your eyes, you realize you are melting into a sea of white laces! Your arms desperately try to hold onto something, but they keep grabbing lace again and again. As your head is about to melt in too, a last breath leaves you just enough time to break the spell and return to normal, totally exhausted.
</TFMessage_100_Percent_1st>

<TFMessage_Completed_1st>You're too exhausted to even try to block the spell. You close your eyes and drift away as the spell hits you at its full power. You are submerged by happiness, knowing you'll make someone look girly and sexy wearing you. Meanwhile, you literally melt into a pond of white lacy material. First your legs. Then your torso. You open your eyes to see what you're becoming and you simply smile as your head also turns into white laces. Your arms follow, but they form a circle, an elastic band to hug your new owner's waist. As you are being picked up, you can feel all your layer of frills quivering to the breeze. The sensation is so pleasurable. You can't wait to be worn. After all, better getting used to it because you're now one of the most girly pieces of clothing around and every girl in town will fight to have you as their white frilly petticoat...for eternity.</TFMessage_Completed_1st>

<TFMessage_20_Percent_3rd>As you start to cast the spell, faint giggles appear in your mind. They slowly become louder and louder, and you lose your focus. You failed.</TFMessage_20_Percent_3rd>

<TFMessage_40_Percent_3rd>This times, you manage to resist the girly voices invading your mind long enough to finish casting the spell. You notice a thin layer of white lace pouring out the waist of your opponent. They fiddle a little bit with it, and then snap their fingers to make it disappear. You can't help but pout like a little girl.</TFMessage_40_Percent_3rd>

<TFMessage_60_Percent_3rd>You persevere and cast the spell once again. Now, much more thin layers of white laces flow from your opponent's waist, enough to form a small white tutu. The spell seems to also have some kind of mental effect on your victim and you look at them fluffing the tutu. Your opponent also does a little spin, like a ballerina! You can't resist but giggle, but sadly, they cast a spell make the tutu vanish.</TFMessage_60_Percent_3rd>

<TFMessage_80_Percent_3rd>Instead of resisting the girly giggles in your head, you decide to try to channel them towards your enemy. As you bring your arms up front, you produce a beam of light which blinds your opponent. Once again, a small white tutu starts pouring from you target's waist, who can't resist playing with it. You also realize your target is slowly melting onto the ground. In fact, the more they melt, the fluffier and bigger the tutu gets, until it turns into a frilly petticoat. You wait for the transformation to finish, but as your opponent's torso hit the floor, they snap out of their trance. You can see the panic in their eyes as they cast a spell and revert to normal.</TFMessage_80_Percent_3rd>

<TFMessage_100_Percent_3rd>You let the girly giggles flow in your mind as you channel them as much as you can toward your arms. This time, a huge giggling white beam engulfs your enemy and stuns them on their feet. You look at them slowly melting into a pond of lace and turning into a frilly white petticoat. Your target seems so peaceful, so happy about this predicament. You slowly start to lose sight of your victim's head into the petticoat, proud of your win. You approach your transforming victim to pick them up, but suddenly, their arms start agitating in all directions, trying to grab onto something, like someone trapped in quicksand. You back off a little and hear a faint voice. To your amazement, your enemy reverts to normal in front of you, in fetal position, totally exhausted.</TFMessage_100_Percent_3rd>

<TFMessage_Completed_3rd>Now mastering the spell, you channel as much energy as you can. Your arms are trembling and the giggling voices are getting so loud your ears are bleeding. You cast the spell and feel like you're firing a cannonball.  You try to hold the light beam on as long as possible and look at your target melting into a pond of lace. You can judge by the speed of the transformation that they will never recover from it. First their legs, then their torso and as expected, their head quickly disappear into the petticoat. Their lifeless arms also sink in, as if your victim was being swallowed by the filly petticoat. After a moment, you walk over the petticoat. You stare at the frilly piece of clothing on the floor and wonder if it's even safe to pick it up. You can still hear faint giggling laughs coming out of it, but they seem to be slowly fading away. </TFMessage_Completed_3rd>

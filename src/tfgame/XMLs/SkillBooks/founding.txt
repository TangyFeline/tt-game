<b>April 17</b>.  Fate is a cruel mistress!  Today I lost my last two guides in this cursed fog--this ethereal mist that soaks our very bones, clog our throats, suffocates and blinds us pitiful fools!  When the fog set in this morning, we lost all sense of direction save a few short rays of sun that broke through the endless clouds, but this did us no help as we all swore it came from a different direction in the sky!  We began to hear childish giggles in the trees, just out of sight, enough to drive the most learned scholar mad!  And drive the guides mad they did.  The grown men, skilled trackers that they were, dashed off to catch our unseen watchers.  I shouted until my throat was hoarse, but I dared not journey off the trail lest I find myself ensnared by the strange allure!  I heard nothing of them again.  By the time the fog lifted it was late in the evening.  I found their canteens, backsacks, compasses--all their survival gear discarded by the riverside by lantern light, along with their vests and trousers as if they had splashed into the waters like children at play.  Now I am alone, and I must rest.  I shall not turn back… I cannot.<br><br>

<b>April 22</b>.  My supply of hardtack and jerky is exhausted.  I could have sworn I had another package of dried goods sealed tightly up in the leather sack, but now that I look I cannot find it.  I have not seen a living soul in this wilderness since the fog stole away my guide; the chance of thieves having stolen it are nonexistent.  Still, every now and then I hear a giggle up in a tree, behind a rock, sometimes right behind me!  It must be in my mind, but I cannot help but respond.  I am being watched… followed…  Toyed with...<br><br>

<b>April 25</b>.  My stomach rumbles and my hand grows weak.  I have not eaten in days except some young roots boiled in water, but they have made me sick to the stomach and I feel less nourished for my efforts.  I lay against a tree, resting my eyes, awaiting the unending sleep that comes to all mortal men.<br><br>

<b>April 26</b>.  A miracle!  Or perhaps I have perished already?  When I awoke this morning, I found before me a dew-spotted leaf of a plant I have never before seen, green and lush, glowing softly in the dawn as though it held within it its own moon.  Atop it rested a mound of fuschia berries, carrots and mushrooms, leeks and onions.  And to complement it all a silver flask filled with a liquid as thick and sweet and honey!  Greedily I devoured it all, even the minty-flavored leaf upon which it had all been set--a pleasant dessert to finish of the fine feast!.  I looked about for my mysterious benefactor, but apart from the giggles… nothing.  Reinvigorated, I set out once again, a new man with the strength of a stallion in his prime!<br><br>


<b>May 2</b>.  How can this be?  I have not eaten since the meal placed in front of my sleeping body, not once, yet I have no slowed my pace at all, not foraged for food or even felt the desire to eat!  A simple soak of my feet in this stream is all I need to regain my strength and carry on another few days without rest!  And the light of the sun upon my scalp--oh, the ecstasy!  What is this?  Should I be afraid?  Should I rejoice?  I stand still and listen to gentle trickle of the stream, the chirping of the crickets, the chattering of the birds returning home from their long migratory voyages…  I shut my eyes and an hour passes in moments.  Only when night falls do I seem to come to my senses and continue west on foot.<br><br>

<b>May 7</b>.  The days grows longer.  The higher the sun rises in the sky, the longer I find myself stunned by its presence, overwhelmed, enveloped…  My toes dig into the earth, my arms reach up to the sky as if to pull the sun closer, the glorious mother, the giver of life...<br><br>

<b>May 13</b>.  Rooted!  I cannot move!  My body grows tall and slender, my toes grown out into roots slurping up the sweet nutrients of the soil, bark creeping up my shins, my voice growing fainter and more like the rustle of leaves!  Birds perch atop my shoulders.  Not just birds, but small winged women who laugh and poke at me.  Fairies!  When twilight falls I plead with them to stop their taunting and free me from what must be their strange earth magicks, but they do not listen or else do not care, or else dance naked on my outstretched arms and sing hymns to their gods and goddesses upon their new perch.  In a few days what shall remain of me?  Soon I shall be a mere sapling, more conscious than any other but able to do nothing but tilt toward the sun…  It becomes harder to write.  Soon this diary shall fall to the soil and wash away in the rains along with whatever remains of my identity and sanity…  Help! <br><br>

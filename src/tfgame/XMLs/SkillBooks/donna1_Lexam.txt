<span class='booktitle'>Milton Family History: An Investigation </span><br><br>

<i>You open the paperback book and begin to read the notes inside, squinting a little as you notice that the pages are all handwritten before simply being photocopied into this book The following is the salvaged investigation by Kiara Galaway, a reporter who went missing on April 12, 2015 on the outskirts of Sunnyglade on the property of one Donna Milton.</i><br><br>

My name is Kiara Galaway and I have been charged with collecting information on Donna Milton on behalf of the Weekly Babble Newspaper. I have been waiting outside the house for a few hours now and finally notice that a young teenager has left for town. I believe that is Donna's niece but I am unsure. She seems to be the only one in the house at the moment so I am taking my opportunity to sneak inside. <br><br>

I have made it inside the house and it.....looks oddly normal for all the rumors I have heard about this place and the family. I only took this job because I am looking for my friend Nicole, who disappeared on this farm a few weeks ago. But I will find out what these sick people have done with the missing people. <br><br>

After a little searching I have found an old diary in the master bedroom. After I skimmed through it I have come to realize that Donna Milton is crazy! I am copying pages from the diary into my report now. <br><br>

Dear Diary,<br>
It's Donna again......Aunt Circe is so mean sometimes. She changed me into a hen for a week because we were out of eggs for breakfast on monday morning. I do not think I will ever learn how to control my magic with how much she changes me into an animal. I have so many blank spaces in my memory that I think I have been spending more time as a beast then as a human. But she insists this is something I must learn....that if I am going to do this to others I must know how it feels myself. Anyways today is my fifteenth birthday and I was given the day off so that is a good thing at least. Anyways dearest diary I am off to make dinner. <br><br>

Dear Diary,<br>
After 100 years of training the day finally came. Aunt Circe is giving me the mantle of Circe...the ranch....all the livestock....everything. She asked me to change her into a cow to seal the ritual so I did as she asked with a final goodbye. I took her to her new home in the pasture and branded her like all the other cows, I can't believe I was sad to see her freely give up her humanity and mind to pass me the power of Circe. But I understand she has lived a very long time and that she was tired of watching the world progress while she still felt like the young goddess of Greek mythology. I am sad to see her go but I am happy to know that she is now happier with her simple existence. <br><br>

Dear Diary,<br>
I forgot I had this dusty old thing. Ever since my last entry I forgot I threw this in the attic with all of.....Aunties old things. Circine moved in today and Aunty was right. I felt the passage of magic in her body as she changed her entire gym class into animals. She was angry and didn't have any control. I couldn't even change them back after I put her to sleep. Oh well new livestock is welcome on the ranch and mabye one day we can turn them all back. However I must start her training because I can tell that eventually she will be the one to take the mantle from my shoulders. I truely hope she won't come to hate me as I used to hate my Aunty. <br><br>

Do you see what I mean? She is absolutely nuts! She thinks she is over a hundred years old and....oh shit, someone just came into the house! <br><br>


<i>As you continue to read you notice the handwriting is slowly growing sloppier.</i> <br><br>

It was Donna! She came in and simply looked at me with a cross expression until she saw the diary in my hands. She demanded to know why I broke into her house but I managed to run out the open window. I am hiding in the barn now and...I feel strange. I have two bumps on my head and my breasts feel....full <br><br>

<i>You notice the writing grows sloppier</i> <br><br>

So hot....took off my clothes....fur is nice and... Wait what is wrong with me!? My breasts are.....moving down my belly and turning into....an udder? I...I feel so hot and I need to play with myself....no...I need a billy goat to. GROSS! Where did that thought come from! <br><br>

<i>The handwriting becomes scribbles with only a few readable word.</i><br><br>

Help! Hooves hard write...need breed...need billy....not goat I...human <br><br>

<i>You gulp nervously as a very practice hand wrote a few notes on the bottom of the page.</i> <br><br>

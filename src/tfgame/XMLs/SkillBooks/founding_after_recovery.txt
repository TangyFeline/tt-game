The narrative continues below.</i><br><br>

When I awoke the following morning after Jewdewfae had rescued me from my prison of bark, I opened my eyes to find myself laying on my back underneath an all too familiar sight.  I lay slumbering against the wooden trunk in which my conscience had resided for so many eons.  I recognized the familiar partitions of branches, the patterns and knots in the wood, each wounded twig and withered limb whose leaves received only a portion of the sunlight their higher kin stole from the sky.  I shut my eyes and could still feel the tickle of birds' feet and the ants foraging amongst my roots, following their roads over and underneath my bark.  Was it my imagination?  A delusion?  I was ready to disregard no possibility after all I had seen of this strange land.  Fearing if I focused on the sensations of my previous existence for too long that I would find myself imprisoned there once again, I forced myself to sit upright and clamber to my pale soft feet and resume life among this world's bipedal inhabitants.<br><br>

"Good mornin', Biggie!"  I heard my fae companion greet, though I could not see from where she spoke.  I looked down at myself, a most unfamiliar sight, these womanly curves upon my very own body, the alteration of skin and weight of muscles, bone, and fat to match my new sex.  To my surprise, I realized that I was not naked anymore, a long, thick, warm red dress made of some material like a wolf pelt surrounding and comforting me.<br><br>

"Hello?" I whispered weakly, the sweet, womanly voice strange to hear from my own throat.  "Where are you?  <i>Who</i> are you?"<br><br>

Jewdewfae gave no reply at first.  I almost believed she had vanished when I began to feel another draft creeping up along my legs.  I looked down to see my dress growing smaller, parting at the seams yet not tearing as fabric is bound to do.  I sat still and watched as my humble garment shrank down to a small ribbon of cloth around my ankles, then forming into the small winged woman whom I recognized as Jewdewfae.  She had changed herself into the dress to keep me warm!  What strange powers these fae possessed to shift their bodies so effortlessly at will!  I was left naked and exposed with a tiny girl sitting on my toes, staring at me with a warm smile.<br><br>

"Sooo…" the girl giggled.  "Feeling better?  Wanna know a thing or two about what comes next, Biggie?"<br><br>

I nodded and the fae began her retelling of all that had transpired.  When I had eaten the strange fruits off of the leaf so long ago, I had fallen for one if the magical traps set by several of Jewdewfae’s sisters, fae of the ancient migratory clan known simply known as the Elders.  I had not been the first to fall victim to their schemes; thousands of unfortunate mortals before me had succumbed to their trickeries over the millennia.  The Elders cared not for mankind encroaching into these virgin lands, ever deeper and more intrusive, feeling forests for our crops and later crushing the grasses with cobblestone roads.  As an explorer and mapper, laying down the routes for generations more to follow, my hired companions and I had made for the most tempting targets for their vengeance.  Jewdewfae had come across some of my former companions while tracking the path of her sisters, but only I had been fortunate enough to be restored to some semblance of my former self.<br><br>

"How long ago was I changed?" I inquired when she finished her explanation.<br><br>

"Ummm let’s see…" Jewdewfae circled the tree from which I had emerged, thinking carefully and studying its features.  "Based on how wide and tall you grew I'd guess about a hundred years or so, Biggie," she answered cheerfully.  "You were really growing well!"<br><br>

A <i>hundred</i>?   Had so many years truly passed?  The realization dawned upon me that the world I had departed remained no longer, not a soul I had known left alive, my children all grown, aged, and perished with only the faint memory of their father.   Just as well, I told myself, once more gazing down at my youthful womanly body.  Could I truly call myself the same Matthias that had embarked on this mission so many years ago?  Perhaps not, but the desire to know of my legacy and the lives of my children, perhaps meet my grandchildren and great children, flooded my mind.<br><br>

"I thank you for all you have done, but I must return home!" I told the fae, climbing to my feet and sprinting to the east, immediately noticing all of the new female parts of my body which shook and wobbled with each footfall.  I heard Jewdewfae shriek in protest and give chase.<br><br>

"Hey!  You promised you’d play with me!" she shouted, effortlessly catching up to me with the beating of her sleek wings and streamlined, slender body.  "You can’t go!  Stop!"<br><br>

What I was hoping to accomplish then I do not know.  Naked, foodless, weak, and considerably disoriented, I surely would have sooner perished than reach my destination.  But I did not think this at the time.   When Jewdewfae landed on my shoulder, clinging on to my oak colored hair, I swatted her away as if she were a fly, a pest!  How cruel of me in retrospect, to reward my savior with mindless violence.  But she respected my behavior and let me slip free, though I could see that she was still watching and following me from a distance, taking the disguises of wildlife to mask herself.<br><br>

The further I ran, however, the weaker I felt.  Older and wearier, aches returning to my joints that my young body had freed me from without my notice.  The weakness became worse and worse, my skin wrinkling with each step, the perkiness of my feminine curves sagging with the ravages of age.  My hair thinned and my heart beat irregularly until I collapsed, breathless, my life passing away.<br><br>

This was when I felt strong arms heave me up over a brawny woodsman’s shoulders, tossing my fading husk against his neck to be carried back from where I had fled.  I struggled to remain conscious.  Though the form was unfamiliar to me, I knew the woodsman could only be Jewdewfae, rescuing me once again.  The closer he carried me my tree-body the more life and youth returned to me, revitalized by proximity to its leaves and bark.  At last he returned me to the tree itself and set me down back on my feet, his face sad and weary.  He needed not explain.  I was not truly free.  I could never truly go home, to venture from this sacred and cursed forest.  It was not my imagination that I could still faintly sense everything that the tree could.  I was still bound to it in spirit; our lives were still one even if our bodies were not.  Overcome by emotion in a way I have not since a young boy, I broke into tears.<br><br>

Jewdewfae silently comforted me, embracing me from behind, wrapping his arms around me protectively as my tears trickled onto his arms.  He stroked my hair and massaged my quivering shoulders, his tender fingers warm and smooth and soft.  I embraced the warmth, the comfort, the presence of company and friendship.  When my eyes ran dry and had no more tears to shed,  I turned around and gazed deep into his sparkling blue eyes.<br><br>

Once more I cannot explain why I acted as I did just then.  I kissed Jewdewfae, a long embrace, his lips warm against mine.  He returned my passion as eagerly as I provided it.  He lowered me to the ground on a soft bed of leaves.  There he lay with me for many hours, gifting me with the intense and wonderful new ecstasy of being made love to in the body of a young woman.  As the hours passed we made love unending, Jewdewfae shifting between man and woman based on the mood of the moment, both of which I found equally stimulating to my insatiable lust.<br><br>

Hours passed into days, days into weeks, months of joyful playing and frolicking followed by nights of love.  I had no need of food nor water; my tree half provided us with all the sustenance needed from the sun, soil, and rain.  Jewdewfae showed me all the shapes she could take and slowly even I learned how I could reshape my skin and bones at will, to change myself into a deer or bird or fish as could my fae lover, to spawn with her in the creek or curl up together in a sparrow’s nest and sing our mating calls. <br><br>

I should not have been surprised when my belly began to swell and my breasts plump with mother's milk.  Once again my life would change in ways I could never have imagined.

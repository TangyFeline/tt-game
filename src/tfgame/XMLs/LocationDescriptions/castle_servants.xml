<Description>You are in the servant quarters of Valentine's Castle.  This area was once used by most of the castle live-ins. You can see some simple beds attached to modest bedside cabinets. Even so, you think that living here must have been easy and pleasant--certainly more so than at the Erie Estate, at any rate.</Description>

<Description>You are at the Milton Ranch, a famous... or infamous... local landmark you've heard about from whispers and rumors.  You are currently standing on the wooden planks of a shady porch that looks over the property.  It seems to be perfect for sipping tea and plotting who to turn into livestock.</Description>

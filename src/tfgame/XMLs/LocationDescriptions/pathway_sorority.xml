<Description>This is the west end of a heavily forested dirt road - oaks and sycamores fill the areas to the north and south. To the west, you can see the sorority house; while its girls are known to welcome visitors to their rear entrance, uninvited guests tend to be dealt with extremely harshly. The road extends far to the east from here, passing the shores of Sapphire Lake to reach the main St. Circe's Campus, and then onward past the town pool towards Main Street.</Description>

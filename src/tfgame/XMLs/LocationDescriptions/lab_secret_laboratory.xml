<Description>You in a secret laboratory of Dr. Hadkin's Research Clinic, a damp basement down a creaky set of dark stairs.  There is a sharp, pungent smell to the air, something strange and biological.  There isn't too much down here except a manhole leading to yet deeper, stranger depths, but it's inaccessible due to being flooded with a pink substance leaking out of a large glass tank.  Something almost seems to be splashing down in the goo, but what?  Or maybe even who?</Description>

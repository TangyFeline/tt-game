<Description>You are in the Sunnyglade Public Pool.  You are at a small playground in an otherwise empty grassy lot, a place for kids to play during adult swim or simple sunbathing.  You feel a pang of nostalgia for your childhood, back around the time when your parents first told you you had special abilities, magic, that most kids did not.  There don't seem to be any visitors here, other than your spell casting peers.</Description>

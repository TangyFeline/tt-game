<Description>You are in the throne room of Valentine's Castle.  Like everything in this castle the throne dazzles the senses. The throne itself is made of a beautiful white crystal. Its backrest is carved to resemble a pretty woman with enormous wings.  As you look closer you can swear that you see a single red coloured tear dropping from her eye. Is that blood? On the eastern wall you notice a painting of an even more stunning lady, though she's not the same person as on the throne. Under the painting rests a crystal piano made from a mysterious and fragile looking blood-red crystal. People in this castle certainly liked crystals...</Description>

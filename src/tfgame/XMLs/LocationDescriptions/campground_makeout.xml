<Description>Several benches line the hilltop here, facing west, giving a spectacular view of both the forested area below and the crystal-blue waters of the lake to the south. While during the day the area is filled with nature lovers, hikers, sometimes even families coming to watch the sunset; a discarded condom behind the bench suggests the quite different reputation this area has by night. Frequented by the nearby college students - and most notably by sorority girls, whose house can just barely be seen to the northwest - the area has come to be known as "Make-out Point". Few of its denizens are about at the moment - though given the legends surrounding the adjacent campground, this is perhaps for the best.</Description>

<Description>The back yard offers the girls of the sorority a place to indulge in outdoor recreation with a measure of privacy (if one doesn't count the unobstructed view to the south). The lawn could use a good mow, but foot traffic keeps the grass from getting out of hand. There's an inflatable pool and a hose over near the patio, where girls can rinse off after a marathon tanning session, and nearby several lawn chairs are arranged around a bonfire pit used for those all-nighters when the fraternity boys come calling. There is a volleyball net, where the girls engage in fierce competition to demonstrate their athletic prowess (actually, the competitions usually end in giggles, hugs, and heavy petting, leading to demonstrations of another kind). Of course, the centerpiece of the yard is the legendary Sorority Tree of Eta Gamma Mu, lovingly adorned with bras and panties generously donated by alumni, and the massive treehouse high in its boughs. If you look closely, you might see the sorority's mascot cat sleeping up in the branches.</Description>

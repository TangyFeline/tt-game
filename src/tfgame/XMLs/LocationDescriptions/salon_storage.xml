<Description>You are inside the Blazes and Glamour Beauty Spa.  You have slipped inside an unlocked storage room, a small area that's absolutely cluttered with boxes of lipstick, hair dyes, towels, makeup, and all other tools of the trade strewn about with no apparent organizational scheme, much in contrast to the rest of the orderly building.  The tile floor is an entire rainbow of different colors from over the years, all the spilled hair dye and chemicals that probably went uncleaned for days or weeks.</Description>

<Description>You are standing outside near some dumpsters of a local pub named the Smelly Sorceress sitting on the corner of 14 and Main.  The area reeks of old nachos, stale fries, rotting hamburgers, and other food so terrible that only a drunkard would buy it.  Being a bar, however, the Smelly Sorceress must have plenty of those.</Description>

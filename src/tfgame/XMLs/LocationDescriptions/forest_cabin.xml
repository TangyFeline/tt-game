<Description>You are standing by the burnt ruin of a settler's cabin in the Scarlet Forest.  Strangely enough there doesn't seem to be any mention of this landmark, not even rumors.  You walk around, peering inside a half-melted, warped glass window at blackened furniture inside.  It looks as though lightning must have struck it some years ago but the fire was doused out by the rain before spreading out to the surrounding vegetation.  Other than an old rusty shovel and iron wagon wheel, there's little left to reveal who lived there or how long, yet another mystery in this bizarre little town.</Description>

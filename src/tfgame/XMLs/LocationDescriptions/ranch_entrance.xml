<Description>You are at the Milton Ranch, a famous... or rather, an infamous local landmark you've heard about from whispers and rumors.  You can feel the area tingle with frequently discharged magic.  Before you stands a lush and well kept ranch.  Within eye shot is a barn and a ranch house.  The sounds of animals can be heard all around as one time humans attend to their daily lives as farm animals.</Description>

<Description>You are standing in the antechamber of the Silent Caverns, a large, damp chamber with multiple tunnels leading deeper into the gloomy shadows.  You hold your hand up and mutter a common spell, illuminating your path with a pale blue orb that follows just behind you, pretty much the first spell you ever learned.  Massive stalagmites weep icy drops of sediment-carrying water, landing on your arms and shoulders every now and then and sending a chill to your skin.  Some muddy footprints show you're not the first person here, not to mention a wide fire pit that looks to have been built up and burnt away dozens of times over the years.  Some chirping echoes down the tunnels, bouncing off the walls such that it is impossible to tell which direction it came from.  You look around at the various tunnels, wondering which one to dare traverse first.</Description>

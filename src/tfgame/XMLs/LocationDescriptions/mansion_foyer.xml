<Description>You are in the Abandoned Erie Estate.  You are standing in the foyer of the mansion, an elegant hallway lined with thick marble columns and ending in a grandiose carpeted stairway with portraits of men and women long dead staring down at you.  The interior of the mansion seems to be in relatively good shape save for a thick layer of dust.  A draft blows through the silent hallway, chilling you to the bone as your imagination starts to get the best of you.</Description>

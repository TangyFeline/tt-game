<Description>A lonely bra discarded on the ground suggests that you are by far the first to climb the ladder, and stand on the tiled rooftop of the sorority house. It's a beautiful day - not only do you have an excellent view of the trees surrounding the house, as well as much of the campus of St. Circe's - you can even just make out Main Street, far in the distance. It is so peaceful, so tranquil up here that you have to work to suppress an urge to break the silence surrounding you, to shout from the rooftop about all of the things that are best in life. But whether you shout or maintain the quiet serenity, you will eventually have to return the way you came, climbing back down the rickety ladder to the world below.</Description>

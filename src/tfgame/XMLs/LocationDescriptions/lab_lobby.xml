<Description>You are in the lobby of Dr. Hadkin's Research Clinic.  The building is small and windowless.  It looks as though it has few visitors other than the occasional concerned investor.  The lobby is absolutely bare, the computer at the receptionist desk looking to be at least fifteen years old and maybe used only two of them.</Description>

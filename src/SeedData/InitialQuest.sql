[b][i]I SEEK MY AGENT.[/b][/i]

The Voice echoes disembodied in your head.  The words course through your brain, surging through your thoughts and pushing aside all other concerns.  You can''t shut it out.  The dark figure before you never seems to grow any closer nor farther away, just... there.  Watching and waiting, shrouded in the tumultuous, timeless clouds and lightning spreading off each direction into infinity.

[b][i]YOU MUST GO TO SUNNYGLADE.  THIS IS A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN.[/b][/i]

The same words, over and over again.  Demanding, commanding, commandeering...  All you can do is simply float, formless and weightless in this damned dark void.  No feet to carry you away.  No eyes to close to block out the sight of the dark figure from your view.  It''s always been like this, ever since these dreams began to invade your sleep a few weeks ago.  There is nothing you can do other than wait for the dream to run its course and free you back into consciousness.

You swallow and look up at the fellow passengers, men and women of all nationalities and cultures not only of this world but others. Like you were, some are dozing in their seats.  Eerily, none appear to be having very good dreams, murmuring and moaning restlessly until they too snap awake with a haunted expression upon their faces.  You have the suspicion your dreams are hardly unique, that in each and every passenger''s dreams sits the dark figure and its enigmatic whispers...

Other than the hum of wheels on the pavement and the sputtering engine up front, the bus is still and silent.  You''ve not felt like talking much ever since these dreams finally compelled you to finally try and find this Sunnyglade, the destination the dark figure has commanded you to report to so many times.  Report for... what?  From what you''ve read, the town is nothing particularly special, a remote little town nestled in the endless forests, just about as far from the major cities as possible in this area of the nation.  This old gray bus was the only means of transportation here that you could find.  And yet the bus is packed full with all of its passengers arriving at the same destination.  Sunnyglade.

And to make matters even stranger, every single man and woman riding with you shares your arcane abilities.  You can sense the mass concentration of magical energies pent up for far too long.  Each and every passenger, up to the bald-headed man sitting in the aisle seat beside you, is just watching and waiting, itching to end this nonstop hellish twelve hour ride, ready to fire off a few spells and relieve some pressure.  This bus is a powder keg; so many restless witches in one place is an invitation to disaster, all manner of strange and dangerous spells that could change one''s body and mind forever in a matter of seconds.  You gaze among the silent riders, trying to pick out who might be itching to break this uneasy, unspoken mass truce and catch a few eyeing you back .

Suddenly the bus''s loudspeakers crackle to life as the old driver up front wheezes out the announcement that the bus will be arriving in Sunnyglade in five minutes.  End of the line; this wasn''t a usual stop on the route.  There would be no ride back, he warns with a cackle.  You suspect that the number of witches leaving this town will be far fewer than those who enter... you''d best make sure you''re not among the ranks of the missing.

As the bus at long last passes into the outskirts of town, you look out the windows and see some inhabitants outside, or perhaps visitors drawn to the town just like you who caught an earlier bus or another means of travel.  Something glows bright blue, drawing your attention to two young naked women engaging in combat, slinging spells at one another that singe and crackle through the air.  One of the girls misses a step and down she vanishes in a puff of pink smoke.  You just manage to catch sight of the victor lifting up a pair of pink panties from where her opponent stood moments before, a smirk of triumph on her face before she passes out of sight.  A few minutes later the bus honks at a man herding some cows through the road.  No, not just cows--some of the livestock still resemble women, still in the midst of various stages of transformation, mooing mindlessly and following their soon-to-be master.

Finally the bus rolls to a stop by the side of the road.  The doors open with a hiss.  Sunnyglade at last.  You can''t wait to get a breath of fresh air...', 0, 0, NULL, 0, 0, 0)

But the moment it comes your turn to step off, a green wave of energy blasts past from some duel down the road.  You gasp as the wave dissolves away your clothes and belongings, leaving you entirely in the buff with not a penny to your name, along with everyone else within a few dozen feet except the driver.  And if this weren''t bad enough, a man and woman begin to approach you and the other newcomers, their expressions fierce and predatory, their hands raised and poised for a fight.  They give each other a look and laugh and begin to unleash hell.

You have no time to react before the woman shoots a spell that strikes the bald man you''d sat beside.  His eyes shoot wide and he begins to gasp as his skin turns to pink latex.  In a split second he inflates, lifting him off his toes and sending the unfortunately man tumbling up into the sky, head and limbs retracting inside his translucent oval-shaped torso until he has been fully changed into a balloon, floating up and away to be lost and forgotten in the clouds.

You barely dodge a second spell, ducking just in time.  Instead it strikes a woman directly behind you who hadn''t had the chance to react as you did.  She shrieks as two great antlers grow out of her head, wedging in the bus door frame with the growth unimpeded.  The plastic framing gives away first and she stumbles out, scrambling to feet and trying to sprint away, stumbling as her hands and feet condense into hooves, her entire naked body sprouting light tan fur and growing in size, her nose elongating into a nuzzle tipped by a big black, wet nose sniffing at the air.  Before long she has been transformed into an elk, her hooves clattering on the pavement, rapidly at first but slowing down as she spots some weeds growing through the cracks and bites down, paying no attention to the battle raging behind her ragged, stringy tail.

By this time some of the other riders have gathered a defense and begin to return a volley at the attackers, managing to shrink and petrify the man down to a statue before another two fall inanimate.  Your head is spinning... you need to get away from here and gather your bearings!  You can think about equipping yourself later.', 0, 0, NULL, 0, 0, 0)

You choose a random direction and flee, your chest pounding as you leave the flurry of spells behind along with the shrieks and moans of fear, excitement, and intense erotic pleasure and the roar of the bus''s tires as the old man driving squeals off down the road.  You run for a couple minutes, seeking a quiet place to catch your breath.

Finally you find a suitable place and stop, your naked skin slightly sweaty from the effort and the hot sun above.  As you recover, you think of what you need to do first.  You''ll want to find yourself something to wear.  Not just to cover your modesty and keep you warm, but if the article or accessory happens to be occupied with the consciousness of one of your transformed peers, you''ll be able to tap a part of their own magic for yourself.  You might just find a witch or two who willing to gift themselves to you.  Maybe even permanently!  Permission to transform isn''t always required, of course... Nobody could possibly miss psychopaths like that couple from earlier.

You''ll also want to learn some spells by searching around town.  Who knows what manner of inspiration Sunnyglade may provide for all new kinkier and fun ways to transform those who dare pose a threat to you...

Fully recovered from your rough start, you look up and prepare to begin your adventure.  [i]Welcome to Sunnyglade, $PLAYER_NAME$,[/i] you think to yourself.', 0, 0, NULL, 0, 0, 0)

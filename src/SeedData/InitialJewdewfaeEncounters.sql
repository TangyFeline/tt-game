She is too small and light to twist it off, but she seems to be having too much fun just trying to do it by herself.  She giggles and turns to you.[/p]

[p][fae]“Heya there, big buddy,”[/fae] she giggles.  She begins zipping around various candy jars and boxes, pulling out chocolates and other types of sweets and throwing them generally in your direction.  Most fall at your feet.  [fae]“Want some candy?  This kind here is my favorite!  No, wait!  This kind!  Or this one!  I love them all!  Wanna eat some candy with me?  But I mean a LOT of candy, I don’t want to leave here without trying a little bit of everything...”[/fae][/p]', N'[p]Before you can respond, Jewdewfae zips over to your mouth and tosses what is to her an entire armful of different kinds of candy--chocolates, gummies, jawbreakers, bubble gum, licorice, and plenty others you cannot distinguish by taste mixed in with all the others.  Surprised, you gulp and swallow it all down in a single swallow, but all it does is get your stomach growling for more.  You look up to see Jewdewfae growing into an equally plump sister, pulling jars off the shelves and pouring half of its contents into her mouth at once, throwing handfuls more at you, pelting your open mouth and body with sugary goodness.[/p]

[p]The two of you pig out for some time.  When you are both finally satisfied--and most of the candy appears to be gone, though somehow jars that you thought were empty seem to be back on the shelves and full as ever--you slumber over side by side in a food-coma nap.[/p]

[p][fae]“Mmm, that was fun,” Jewdewfae sighs contently as she shrinks back down to her regular fairy body and perches on your belly.  “Thanks for playing with me.  here, have this…”[/fae] she zaps you, fueling your arcane knowledge with fairy magic before zipping off to find another partner to play with.[/p]', N'[p]Jewdewfae giggles.

When she notices you standing there she giggles and abandons her task, letting the glass lid fall back down with a clink.  However, she doesn’t move her tiny fingers away fast enough and some of them get struck with the lid on the way down.[/p]

[p][fae]“Owwwww,”[/fae] she moans, zipping over to you, leaving behind a trail of fairy dust lingering in the air, her flight instead.  She lands on your shoulder and holds her fingers over to your lips as you turn your head to look.  [fae]“Are you a nurse?  I want someone to kiss my fingers and make them feel better.  And then kiss me on the lips, and then kiss me between my thighs…”[/fae][/p]', N'[p][fae]“Oh good, you’re just what the doctor ordered!”[/fae] Jewdewfae sticks her fingers between your lipstick-red lips.  Just as she promised, she then plants her tiny lips against your plump bottom lip, kissing you passionately as her body grows from nine inches tall to a voluptuous five-foot woman without her fairy wings.  [fae]“Come here, you!  I need you to come and check out this strange little pain I’ve been having down here...”[/fae]  She pulls you toward the emergency room and leaps onto a rolling gurney, rubbing her inner thigh.[/p]

[p]You oblige, rubbing some lotion along her legs and thighs as she directs you along her “boo-boos,” closer and closer to her clitoris.  She stares at you with a wide grin, and you focus your attention on her steaming womanhood, pleasuring her with your fingers as she writhes on the gurney in lust.  She gasps loudly and collapses down, sweaty and satisfied.  [fae]“You’re the bestest nurse ever!  Let me pay you back... Here, have this...”[/fae] she zaps you, fueling your arcane knowledge with a bit of fairy magic before returning to her regular body and zipping off to find another partner to play with.[/p]', N'[p][fae]“You don’t look like you’re qualified to treat my ouchie fingers,”[/fae] Jewdewfae giggles.

She hangs off of it with one hand, poised to leap down onto the mattress below.  You watch as she pushes off into the air, giggling and twirling around as she plummets down onto the sheets below.  But when she lands she is greeted by a cloud of dust rising off of every nearby surface, causing her to quickly fly up into the air covering her eyes and wheezing.[/p]

[p]Blinded, Jewdewfae collides with you and clutches onto your neck as she hacks the last bit of dust out of her tiny lungs.  [fae]“That was so much fun, if only this place were a little bit cleaner…”[/fae] she looks up at you, recoiling in mock surprise that she just-so-happened to have flown right into someone.

Well, at least not dirty from dirt...”[/fae][/p]', N'[p][fae]“Oh!  Perfect!  Hola, madamoiselle!  Did I get that right?  Oh, it doesn’t matter.  Come here!”[/fae] Jewdewfae sends a bolt of energy at you, striking your body and making you gasp and strike a sexy pose against your will.  You find yourself blushing as Jewdewfae eyes your body, whistling in approval as she grows into a full-sized woman wearing fine velvet robes, clearly someone rich and powerful.[/p]

[p][fae]“Okay, now, go change those bedsheets, dust the mirror, vacuum the floor, mop up the kitchen, mend up this little tear in my dress, paint the walls a slightly lighter shade of blue, and have my dinner all ready for me in half an hour!  Heehee!  Oh, isn’t this fun, me bossing you around like that?  But maybe you need a sister to help you?”[/fae] in the blink of an eye Jewdewfae’s clothes vanish, replaced instantly by a dress just like yours. [fae] “Oui, oui, let’s get to cleaning!”[/fae][/p]

[p]Cleaning begins and ends with you and Jewdewfae changing the bedsheets but somehow tripping and becoming entangled in them with your clothing mysteriously slipping away.  Ultimately the bed remains as dirty as ever, perhaps with a few more fluids drying on them.  [fae]“Bestest maids ever,”[/fae] Jewdewfae sighs.  [fae]“Time for your paycheck!”[/fae]  She zaps you, filling you with some fairy magic in reward as she flies off.[/p]', N'[p][fae]“Where’s your outfit?”[/fae] Jewdewfae giggles.

She has a pile of rose petals sitting on her lap and around her and she appears to be weaving them into some kind of tiny dress using a needle three inches long which is a third the height of her entire body.  Needless to say she is not doing a very good job.[/p]

[p]As your shadow falls over her she looks up, shrieking in fake innocence as she holds two rose petals up to cover her naked breasts.  [fae]“Oops, oh my, the wind,”[/fae] she giggles as she releases them into the breeze. [fae] “You know those springtime fairies that make their own dresses out of flowers?  Well, they’re having this dance tonight out in the Scarlet Forest and I need a pretty little dress, but these rose petals tear way too easily.  And I think that new girl Jaylee Dewtoes already has one.  Oh, what am I going to do…”[/fae][/p]

[p]She sighs glumly, then looks up, her face glowing.  [fae]“Oh, I know!  I want to make a dress from those big pretty pink flowers that those pretty [b]Alraune[/b] girls all grow!  I don’t suppose you could let me, um, ‘borrow’ one from you?”[/fae][/p]', N'[p][fae]“Oh, perfect!”[/fae] Jewdewfae zips over to you and begins to tug at one of the large pink petals growing out of your hair, but it won’t come out and the more she pulls the more it starts to hurt.  Before you need to ask her to stop hurting you, she gives up on her own.  [fae]“Screw this.  But you know what, I do love the way you smell.  Oh!  I just had the best idea--I’m going to just collect some of that sweet aroma of yours, mkay?”[/fae][/p]

[p]She finds the cap of an acorn and begins to scrape it along your flowers instead, collecting some of the sweet pollen and syrupy juices that your body emits to produce its powerful aroma.  You enjoy the tickling sensation of her actions, tingling with the sensation of being groomed. [fae]“Perfect!  Thankies!  I’m going to smell so wonderful tonight.  Here, have this, you deserve it.”[/fae]  She zaps you, filling you with some fairy magic in reward as she flies off.[/p]', N'[p][fae]“You’re not a flower, silly!”[/fae] Jewdewfae giggles.

You don’t sense any human consciousness coming from them--just plain old non-former-human store props.  Just as you breath a sigh of relief and try to walk past, a small voice calls out [fae]“Hey!  You!  You’re blocking my view, you clumsy biggie!”[/fae][/p]

[p]Startled, you look around and see Jewdewfae the fairy sitting on a stack of folded jeans, staring at the mannequins intently.  She sighs, appearing to be lost in deep contemplation. [fae] “You know, these dresses just aren’t doing it for me.  Would you mind helping me pick one out?  Nah, I don’t want you to tell me what you like, I have my own style.  I just need you to wear them and stand super still, just like these mannequins over here.  Why don’t you get yourself turned into one of those [b]Magical Mannequin[/b] women I’ve seen here and there?”[/fae][/p]', N'[p][fae]“Perfect!”[/fae]  Jewdewfae flies over a line of dresses neatly hanging on a metal rack and begins to hum, picking out a select few but letting most drop to the floor and get wrinkled.  Finally she finishes her selection and flies back over, weighed down by the heap of cloth in her arms.  [fae]“Okay, arms up, let me put this red one on you.  And don’t move.  Unless you’re putting your arms up.  Now put them back down.  And don’t move.  Unless you’re… well, you get what I mean, silly.”[/fae][/p]

[p]You stand perfectly still--something you’re certainly quite adept at in your faceless, enchanted wooden body--and watch through the magic of the rune on your head as Jewdewfae slips on a slinky pink dress over your body and flies back to her heap of jeans, resuming her contemplation.  [fae]“Hm… no… not quite... let me go grab another…”[/fae][/p]

[p]After repeating this process for what feels like hours, you suddenly hear Jewdewfae shriek in delight as she flies out of a heap of clothing clutching an ugly skintight yellow dress that makes your inner fashion sense want to leap off of a cliff..

Thanks for your help, biggie.”[/fae]  She sends a zap your way, gifting you with a portion of her fairy magic and vanishes into a dressing room.[/p]', N'[p][fae]“Hm, I don’t think you can stand still enough for me in that body of yours.

At first you can’t see her, but then you notice that she’s carrying a chewed-up plastic frisbee and trying to fly away with it, pursued by a Husky intent on recovering its chew toy.  [fae]“Go away, dumb dog!  Mine!”[/fae] Jewdewfae scolds. [fae] “We’re playing fetch, not tug-o-war!  Let!  GO!”[/fae][/p]

[p]With a surprising display of physical prowess from a tiny winged girl, she manages to wrench it out of the dog’s jaws and flies high up in the air, hiding up in a cloud until the dog loses interest and wanders away.  You’re about to do the same when you see the frisbee zooming straight at you.  Instinct kicks in and you just manage to clutch it out of the air before it smacks you in the face. [/p]

[p] [fae]“Oh hey!  You’re not bad!”[/fae] she zips over to you and lands on your shoulder, her skin sweaty and showing through a tear in her dress about the size of a canine tooth.  [fae]“Real dogs are dumb and smelly.  I like playing with people-dogs instead, much smarter and they don’t pee on the floor.  As much.  Hey, I don’t suppose you wanna play dog with me?  I’ll be the biggie and you the doggy girl… how about a [b]Bitch in Heat[/b]?”[/fae][/p]', N'[p]Jewdewfae squeals, clapping her hands as she sees you approach, crawling on your hands and needs as your six breasts jiggle below you.  [fae]“Good girl!  I like you!  Now go fetch!”[/fae]  She winds her arm and throws the frisbee as hard as she can, spinning in circles a few times to build up speed before she releases it.  Instinct takes over and you bark, chasing it in your clumsy half-human half-dog body.  When you find the frisbee and start to trot back with it in your teeth, Jewdewfae is gone, but instead you find a large black labrador in his place with Jewdewfae’s familiar scent..  Your sharp nose detects his lust, the pheromones causing your own body to begin to crave a good humping and release your own, a self-reinforcing feedback loop that can only end one way.[/p]

[p]The two of you begin to circle around, sniffing one another’s sexes until the two of you can take it no longer.  You bend down, wet womanhood raised invitingly up, as Jewdewfae in her male dog body mounts you and begins to hump excitedly.  You yelp and bark as you are lost to pleasure.  When he finally rolls off of you, you collapse and take a nap as Jewdewfae licks the sweat off of your face.[/p]

[p]When you wake up you see Jewdewfae back in her normal fairy body, petting your soft fur.  When she sees that you are awake she giggles and scratches your head by your ears.  “So I might have lied a little about what game I wanted to play,” she teases.  [fae]“You’re quite a naughty bitch, you know that?  I just couldn’t pass that up.  Anyway, thanks for the fun!  Catch you later!”[/fae]  She zaps you, gifting with some of her fairy magic, and flies off.[/p]', N'[p][fae]“I can play frisbee with any one of you biggies or any old dumb canine mutt.

You turn and see a strange, light-blue blur zooming around the track, sailing a few feet off the ground, circling the track over and over well over a hundred miles an hour.  Curious, you sit down on a bleacher and watch, trying to figure out just what in the world you are looking at.  It seems the thing is slowing down over time, its path becoming a little more erratic and uneven until it shoots out of its way entirely, tumbling straight at you! [/p]

 [p]Something clangs underneath you as it strikes metal.  [fae]“Owwwww...”[/fae] you hear Jewdewfae moan.  You peek down to see her lying dizzy and exhausted on a lost cheerleader pom-pom.  [fae]“Oh no, I dropped the pocketwatch again, dangit dangit dangit!  You dummy,”[/fae] she sighs to herself.[/p]

[p]The bleachers creak as you begin to stand up.  Jewdewfae hears it and flies up, landing on your shoulder and mopping some sweat off of her face with the hem of her dress.  [fae]“Oh, hey there.  Can you help me with something?  I’m trying to learn how to fly faster, so I’ve been going around this track as fast as I can.  I think I can do a lap in under four seconds, but it’s just so frustrating taking a quarter second too long, you know?  I think I need something to cheer me on so I can get my time down to three seconds.  Oh!  You should be a cheerleader and dance while you yell stuff at me!  But you gotta do it right, like one of those [b]Chatty Cheerleaders[/b] around here...”[/fae][/p]', N'[p][fae]“Perfect!  I feel inspired already!  Can you sing something like ‘Go go fairy girl, you can do it!’  Nah, that just sounds dumb.  ‘Maybe ‘Go Go Jewdewfae, this is your day!’  Nah, that doesn’t work either.  Um.  Just jump up and down a lot and cheer, okay?”[/fae]  Jewdewfae hands you a stopwatch and takes her position at the start line.  [fae]“Okay, three, two, one... go!  Oops, false start.  On the count of three.  Go!”[/fae][/p]

[p]A gust of wind blows against your clothes as the fairy launches off, beginning her lap.  Once you recover from your disbelief at how fast she can fly when she puts her mind to it, you do what your own current body does best--cheer!  You scream out to Jewdewfae with all the chants, songs and cheers of encouragement that have been seared into your mind from your semesters in Saint Circe’s (or rather the magic that has gives you the memories of such).  It’s a shame hardly anyone is around to see you, and you wonder if Jewdewfae can even see or hear you when she zooms by.[/p]

[fae]“But I’m so tired now, lemme take a quick nap…”[/fae] she falls silent and for a moment you wonder if she has collapsed in exhaustion right there in your shirt, but she lazily climbs out and flutters back to the bleachers.  [fae]“I’m gonna rest a while and try again later.  Thanks for the help though!  Here, have this.”[/fae]  She zaps you, filling you with some fairy magic in reward as she flies off.[/p]', N'[p][fae]“Hm.  No, you don’t look very inspiring right now.

Finishing it off, she holds it up as if trying to see if there is a single drop left that she can coax out.  Sighing, she tosses it down to the grass, letting it roll a few feet away in the wind.  She notices you and flies over, landing on your shoulder.[/p]

[p][fae]“Hey there, biggie,”[/fae] she greets you.  [fae]“I love being out here on the farm.  So much more organic and fresh and close to nature.  Well, except for the forest.  And the mountains.  And out in the middle of a lake.  Or the ocean I suppose.  But the ocean doesn’t have any cows!  Well, they do have sea cows, but those don’t really count now do they, you silly biggie?  You know what?  I’m still thirsty, and that milk wasn’t very fresh anyway.  Probably been sitting in a truck for weeks.  I don’t suppose you could help out?  I want some fresh milk, straight from the udder, from a nice, fine, mature cowgirl. Specifically one of those adorable [b]Milk Maids[/b].”[/fae][/p]', N'[p]Jewdewfae licks her lips, staring at your four large breasts, sloshing with milk and the udders jutting out of a pink bulge below.  [fae]“Mmmm, perfect. Just what the good doctor ordered.  Follow me!”[/fae]  She leads you into the barn and sits you down on the hay while she drags a metal tin pail under you.  She grabs ahold of one of your nipples, tugging at it gently, though her small fairy hands have some difficulty coaxing your nurturing milk out.  Frustrated, she flies sideways and puts her tiny, bare feet against your skin, clutching the udder and pulling away with all of her strength.[/p]

[p]You moan and moo as a spurt of milk splashes out, striking her in the face and knocking her out of the air.  She tumbles into the straw, her tiny dress soaked and her body dripping with your white warmth.  Giggling, she pulls herself to her feet and shakes free of the straw clinging to her damp body.  [fae]“Yum!  Wow!  Delicious!  Gimme more!”[/fae][/p]

[p]Being the obedient and loyal maid that you are, you follow Jewdewfae’s command and lift her up to a different udder, holding her up to your chest and gently rubbing it with your free hand, allowing the milk to flow out.  It still comes out too fast for the tiny fairy to keep up with and most of it ends up running down and off your bodies, pooling on the wooden ground and making a pale mud from the dust below.  When it seems as if Jewdewfae will explode if she takes another gulp, she backs away with a content grin on her face, which quickly turns into a wince. [fae]“Ooh, I gotta go take a leak.  Be right back.  Actually, have this first.  Catch you later!

How about one of those [b]Cupcake Demons[/b]?"[/fae][br][br]', N'[fae]"All right!  Now we can see who''s the steel chef!  Iron chef?  Aluminum chef?  ...Whatever!  Follow me, biggie!"[/fae][br][br]

You follow Jewdewfae as she zips back into the kitchen.  The scent of burnt bread and sugar still lingers in the air, but at least the alarms have gone silent.  Or, rather, you notice that the fae has "disabled" them by tearing them off the walls and tossing them into a sink with soaking  dishes.

[fae]"All right, biggie, now this is how it''s gonna be.  We''re gonna prove who''s the better baker here.  First to bake a baker''s dozen cupcakes and ice ''em all up and eat them all too is the better cook.  I warn ''ya, biggie, nobody knows flours like a fae!  Get it?  Get it?  Flowers, like... nevermind.  Go!"[/fae]  Jewdewfae begins to hum and sift through the refrigerators, pulling out a carton of eggs and sets at her task.  You''d have thought that only being nine inches tall would slow her down.  It probably would, too, if she were concerned about whether or not she left behind a mess.  Not wanting to fall behind so early, you retrieve the ingredients you need.  You''d much rather prefer to transform some bystander into the dough, give your recipe that extra bit of life-zest to it that you crave so much, but you''ll have to settle for what you have on hand for now.[br][br]

You quickly whip an apron around your breasts and your voluptuous thighs, settling into your task with expert flicks of your hand.  You use your nimble tail to mix in the dry and wet ingredients into the batter while the fae works in the corner across from you.  [fae]"Oops!  Watch out!"[/fae] you hear behind you.  You spin around to see a rain of garlic cloves fall around you, getting all over your cutting board and a few plopping inside the batter.  [fae]"My bad!  But a good cook anticipates everything, isn''t that right?"[/fae] Jewdewfae giggles.  You grumble and pick the garlic out, wasting precious time.  You''d quite like to mix her into the batter...[br][br]

Before long the both of you have cupcake pans filled and slid into the oven, baking at high temperature and giving you the time to whip up some icing from eggs and sugar.  You lick your lips, hungry to taste your creation even more, when Jewdewfae lands on your shoulder and squirts half a bottle of habanero barbecue sauce into your bowl.  The fae bursting into fits of giggling.  [fae]"I don''t think ya got the recipe right!"[/fae] she teases.[br][br]

You''ve had enough and grab the fae, whispering an incantation as she squirms in your hand, protesting loudly.  Now it''s your turn to grin as the fae dissolves into a stream of white vanilla icing interspersed with blue sprinkles the same color as her dress.  You expected a bit more resistance from a fae than a mere mortal.  The oven dings and you pull the cupcakes out, sticking a butter knife into the fae-icing and carefully spreading it over the baked goods at your leisure.  A few times you hear muffled shrieks as the fae fights to regain her form, but a few whaps with the knife and a counter-spell ensures she remains right where you want her.[br][br]

With the last cupcake decorated, you sigh and take a big bite.  [i]So this is what a fae tastes like[/i] you think to yourself, swishing the icing around on your tongue and swallowing.  You can''t help yourself and gobble the cupcakes down in less than a minute, Jewdewfae''s faint moans and giggles coming from somewhere deep within you as she helplessly intermingles with your saliva.  Just a matter of time before she joins the fat on your thighs.  But all of a sudden you begin to feel a pressure building up in your throat and mouth, and no matter how hard you clench your jaws to keep it in, gas escapes from your throat, a long, loud belch that lasts so long you almost start feeling faint from the lack of breath!  You double over, sweating as the pressure subsides enough for you to look up and see Jewdewfae sitting in front of you with a big grin, fully recomposed.[br][br]

[fae]"All right, biggie, you win...  This time..."[/fae] Jewdewfae flies off leaving you gasping for air and a taste of icing.  At least not all is lost--she stayed in you just long enough to absorb some of her magic.  You shrug and wander off yourself with some thoughts of turning some passers-bys outside into some lovely glazed donuts... ', N'[fae]"Nah, I don''t think ''yer even gonna stand a chance like that.

The Smelly Sorceress is a pretty nice part of Sunnyglade, all things considered, relatively free of the craziness and occasional lonely emptiness of the outskirts of town.  Wild eyed psychopathic spellslingers tend not to last long in here, and Rusty is always willing to lend an ear no matter how mundane your problems.  You call out to Rusty for a shot of Wizard Haxkaliorion’s Finest Aged Spiced Rum and lie back.[/p]

[p][fae]“Hey, Biggie, you know what’s kinda weird about this place?”[/fae] a lively blonde woman asks, tapping your arm lightly as she sits on the stool beside you.  You watch as she neatly folds up her translucent, glimmering fairy wings, the crystal platelets vanishing as she makes herself comfy against your shoulder.  She is none other than Jewdewfae assuming human woman form, you quickly realize.[/p]

[p][fae]“Rusty’s taste in music suuuuucks!  It’s so old and stuffy!  I mean, just listen, the speakers here are all blown out and tinny!  You can hear that right?  Right right right?  Riiiiiiiiight?  I mean, it’s better than listening to just the birds and wind and ocean like i had to do before you Biggies came along.  I mean, yeah, i guess my sisters kinda sing too but I’ve been listening to that for tens of thousands of years, ugh, talk about getting a tune stuck in your head!  Makes your classical music sound like the hot new thing in comparison.  Uggggh.  Um… what was I talking about?”[/fae][/p]

[p]You open your mouth to reply but the fae only interrupts again, but not before intercepting the glowing pink shot of rum you’d ordered and tossing it in her mouth, shotglass and all, and swallowing it all down.  Annoyed, you turn to wave Rusty down, hoping he knows better than to put that one on your tab.[/p]

You even reach out to make sure you get it for real this time, but Jewdewfae licks her lips and flashes a mischievous smile.  Before you can protest she leaps up on the bar counter, diving at the unphased bartender and yanking the glass from his hand, spilling half its contents in the process. You try not to stare at her cute pale ass, but you can’t help but notice her distinct lack of panties or underwear of any sort.  Jewdewfae downs the shot and twists her shoulders waist around to face you, keeping her butt in full view of your gaze  [fae]“Ah ah ah!  No boozing up before the show!”[/fae] she half scolds and half giggles, wiggling her hips at you.[/p]

[p]You clench your teeth and gracefully leap up to the stage where an old soundboard and turntable has already been set up.  It’s been years since they’ve been paid attention to it based on the thin veil of dust coating them.  Better than nothing, but… it’ll have to do.  All eyes are on you as your nimble fingers move about plugging the cables back in, tuning some knobs, coaxing the old gentle monster of a sound system back to life.  It has been awhile since you worked on a setup like this, but you feel the music flowing through you, guiding your fingers in eager anticipation of being heard by the patrons of the tavern.[/p]

Give a warm welcome to my Biggie friend here, DJ… uh… DJ Deejay!”[/fae] Jewdewfae shrieks excitedly, jumping up on the counter, and pointing your way with dramatic flair.  And at that very moment you allow the magic of the music flow through you, speakers crackling to life with a long sustained chord building up the excitement until the beat kicks in.[/p]

[p]It doesn''t take long before an hour has passed.  By the end Jewdewfae is dancing and making out with other patrons, all the while wearing nothing but a glowing neon bikini that changes color to her movements, transformed with permission an enthusiastic young couple.

Upon closer look, you see that the advertisement text says that she is giving out autographs in the bookstore.  This event is being held today.[/p]

[p]Going up to the Pervwriter’s (Pervywriter’s? Pervriter’s?) stall, you notice that the fae is human-sized, probably to make distributing autographs quicker. However, she is anything but busy as she tosses her writing feather around in boredom.  No one seems to be around yet. As you get close you can hear her murmuring [fae]“Why did I choose to hold a session in the bookstore? How does it work in movies?...”[/fae] As soon as she notices you her bored expression shifts to one of both mischievousness and excitement.

[p]She goes on and on forever about her tales of wonder... and her tales of writing pain. Your gaze moves to the table’s contents where countless lewd doodles and illustrations made by the fae reside. You have to admit that she is indeed talented!  Most of them are scenes from her stories: girls becoming lingerie, boys transforming into wincing maids, consummating, footlicking, etc.  As she catches your gaze, a wide grin spreads across the fae’s face.[/p]

[p]Jewdewfae flies away to bring a pot of ink to your side. Quickly shrinking down and shedding her clothes, she dips herself into the ink, becoming a black dart. [fae]“Eeek! Cold!”[/fae] She begins to move erratically to warm up, splattering you a bit in the process.  She then strolls to your head and hugs your nose; painting it with her weighty bosom. Giggling to herself, the fae throws herself fully into her work, literally, she begins to flop onto your face,creating ink angels everywhere she can.  After a few cycles of re-inking and drawing, Jewdewfae gets quite excited and entirely forgets that you are a person as she begins to use your roughly textured nose to get off. Ink drops down onto your eyes, and the last thing you see is how violently she is pleasuring herself, rubbing her sex an inch from your eyes.[/p]

[p]You hear the panting followed by the satisfied exhale.  [fae]“And that, Biggie, is my autograph!”[/fae] Jewdewfae looks down only to witness the wet and black mass which your face has become. [fae]“Oh, but yer'' sucha mess... lemme clean you up.”[/fae]  But instead of removing the ink the fae moves to your edges and slowly begins to unfold you. With each flattened fold you feel your senses numb, your perception become just as bland as your shape. In no time at all you feel very flat - in fact, you are lying as flat as a recently transformed piece of magic paper.  Luckily this doesn''t last for long as she mercifully refolds you into a new configuration. In a minute you are in perfect shape once more.[/p]

[p]Yet something feels off. Your senses are shuffled and... inappropriate. You can behold the naked and now ink-free Jewdewfae as your new unstained eyes gains sensitivity. The fae doesn’t make any further changes and instead begins to rub her tits against your papery nose.  It feels very tingly in a pleasurable way.  And you feel so wet down between your legs.  You can’t see, but you are dripping with little pervy Jewdewfae images as you get closer and closer to release, a little bit of aesthetic magic from the fae. You give in; there is no point in resisting.  Jewdewfae rubs against you until you experience release soon enough.  You peer down to discover your thighssoaked with Jewdewfae’s "Autographs".

You follow, dodging trees on the courtyard and the decor in the crystal hallways, pursuing closely behind her giggles and flapping blue dress.  Finally she settles down on the top of a great chandelier hanging from the ceiling in the castle''s great hall.  Up above where nobody below can see, Jewdewfae indeed has assembled a nest woven togethet from stolen panties and stockings from the resident vampire queen.  The cloth is padded nicely down, though some are sticky and crusty with…  You have a fair notion what.[/p]

Eventually it becomes evident that your stamina is greater and her wings simply can’t keep up the pace. Jewdewfae finally makes a stop to cleanse away soreness, but you use this to your advantage.

[fae]"No, I''m gonna drink up all your earthling milk!"[/fae] you giggle back as Jewdewfae yelps in pleasure.[/p]

[p][fae]"Oh--oh yeah?  Think we Biggies are just gonna capitulate just like that?"[/fae] Jewdewfae replies.  [fae]"Well, I''ve gotta surprise twist for you!  You might be the kitty from Nip-Nip Fifteen... but we humans are the REAL monsters!"[/fae] [/p]

[p]You feel her body tremble and begin to grow at an alarming rate and leap off of her, landing gracefully a few feet away.  You take a few steps back as she grows from five feet to six, seven, ten, fifteen, thirty!  What little remains of her cheerleader outfit stretches and snaps away around the growing giantess, leaving her naked and towers up above you the size of an oak tree.  Your heart races and you try to scamper away as she takes a swipe at you, grabbing you in her giant hands around your hair and antennae, lifting you up into the air and dangling you a story above the ground.  [fae]"Counter-attack of the fifty foot woman!"[/fae] she giggles, licking the entire front of your body and drenching your blue fur with one stroke of her giant pink tongue![/p]

[p]You mewl and squirm your way out of her hands, leaping at the nearest tree and catching a branch in the way only a feline can.  When you turn back to look, the giant Jewdewfae has vanished, presumably shrunk back down into her normal fae body and off to look for more fun elsewhere.  You groom your fur, feeling a tingle of magic from Jewdewfae''s saliva strengthening your arcane abilities as you clean and align your fur with your own tongue.[/p]', N'[p][fae]"Oh, wait a second.

Home to toned, well-muscled body-builders and fit women in shorts and tank tops. Today is no different! Entering the cardio-hallway, you are greeted by the scent of sweat and the sight of people working out on the various different kinds of machines. There’s two female kitsune running on the treadmill. There’s a man in a suit doing some cycling exercises while his secretary is filming him. There’s a fire elemental getting frustrated at the fact that she’s accidentally burning the machine she’s on while a water elemental keeps putting it out again. Only in Sunnyglade would you see this sort of thing. You wander about, trying to find a free machine for yourself when you happen upon an unused treadmill. What’s interesting about this treadmill though is that it is turned on, yet there is no-one around using it. It seems rather strange but that’s when you look down and see that its user is actually a small fairy. Clad in blue, the fairy has blonde hair, pointed ears and blue symbols on her body. You recognize her of course as one of the most famous (or infamous, if you’ve fallen to one of her pranks!) people around town, the fairy Jewdewfae. It seems that she is jumping around on the machine and using her wings to twirl around in the air. Whatever she’s doing, she’s not exactly using the treadmill for its intended purpose. After a few more hops, skips and jumps, it seems she finally notices your presence. She halts mid twirl and hovers in front of your face.[/p]

[p][fae]“Sorry, Biggie, this one’s taken,”[/fae] she says with a grin. You can’t help but laugh now.[/p]

[p][fae]“Something funny?”[/fae] she asks, tilting her head curiously. [fae]“Even fairies need to work out from time to time, ya know.”[/fae][/p]

[p]“Sorry,” you tell her, “but that’s not how you use a treadmill.”[/p]

[p][fae]“Is that so, huh?”[/fae] she looks down at the apparatus. [fae]“I did think it looked quite odd for a trampoline… So I take it ‘ya know how to use this thing properly then, huh? Huh? Huh?”[/fae] the fairy is all up in your face, a huge smile plastered across her face.[/p]', N'[p]“Why yes!” You tell Jewdewfae excitedly. Your fit, furry body stands as an example to anyone working out in the gym. When someone needs any help with exercises, you’re their squirrel. You like helping them out after all![/p]

[p][fae]“Great!”[/fae] The fairy says excitedly before fluttering down, looking up expectantly.[/p]

[p]“So… this is a treadmill. You run on it, like a hamster,” you explain.[/p]

[p][fae]“Like this?[/fae]” she asks and she starts running forwards on the black belt. Of course, she’s not actually making any progress since the belt is constantly moving backwards.[/p]

[p]“That’s it, you’re doing it,” you tell her but it seems that Jewdewfae isn’t really all that into it.[/p]

[p][fae]“What’s the point… of this thing… Biggie?”[/fae] she says in between some pants. [fae]“I’m… not moving forwards at all!”[/fae] She must not be into shape at all, considering she has only been running for a few seconds now. Makes you wonder how she managed to stay so slim.  No doubt magic.[/p]

[p]“Well no,” you reply, “the point of a treadmill is the running itself.”[/p]

[p][fae]“What?!”[/fae] she asks hysterically and she halts her movements, only for her to be sent flying off the belt and onto the floor, tumbling until she strikes your shin with a loud oof and some words that sound like swearing in an ancient forgotten tongue. You tilt your head. [/p]

[p]“You wanted to work out, didn’t you?” you ask her. Why was this such a shock to the fairy?[/p]

[p][fae]“But this isn’t fun!”[/fae] she pouts, [fae]“I thought ‘ya knew how to have fun.”[/fae][/p]

[p]“Working out IS fun though,” you say with a smile. “You see this body? I didn’t just get this from a transformation. I worked hard for this!” You hope that you sound inspiring enough for her, even if it is a lie.[/p]

[p][fae]“But,”[/fae] she says as she flutters up again, [fae]“‘ya could also just transform… that’s way easier, right?”[/fae][/p]

[p]“Ah, but can you run a marathon and still feel fit enough to run another one afterwards? Because I sure can!” you proudly proclaim. [/p]

[p][fae]“Wow,”[/fae] she says. It seems she’s impressed by that. A good sign! [fae]“Alright, show me!”[/fae][/p]

[p]“Sure!” you say. It has after all been at least an hour since your last exercise and you’re eager as ever to get back into it. You set the treadmill at the highest setting. Easy peasy! Thus you start running. Your fluffy tail bobs up and down with each step, as do your breasts but none of that slows you down. Meanwhile, Jewdewfae is cheering you on from the sidelines.[/p]

[p][fae]“Whooooh!”[/fae] She shouts excitedly, [fae]“Go Biggie!”[/fae] You simply keep on running. Before long, you’ve already run a mile. And another one! And another one! That’s when you notice that the shouts from Jewdewfae have gone silent for a while… looking to your right, you can see that the fairy is lying there on her side on one of the bars with a tiny bag of crisps![/p]

[p]“Oi!” you shout, unable to believe what you’re seeing.[/p]

[p][fae]“Well, keep going, Biggie!”[/fae] she says as she takes a bite of her snack. [fae]“A marathon is much longer than that!”[/fae][/p]

[p]“You’re snacking! In a gym!” you say exasperated. You keep on running still causing you to sweat profusely but that doesn’t matter right now.[/p]

[p][fae]“So?”[/fae] she asks, tilting her head.[/p]

[p]“So?!” you get a bit irritated now. You never get irritated at anyone, but this fairy is simply unbelievable. “You don’t snack in a gym! That’s like turning on a fan in a sauna. It’s the exact opposite of what you’re supposed to be doing here!”[/p]

[p][fae]“Sheesh, gyms are no fun,”[/fae] the fairy pouts before fluttering up again. [fae]“I’ll find some other Biggie to toy with.”[/fae][/p]

[p]“Why you--” you protest and you hop off the treadmill, trying to grab at the fairy. Jewdewfae surprises you though and flies up rather swiftly.[/p]

[p][fae]“Catch me if ''ya can,”[/fae] she says, sticking her tongue out at you with a grin. You can’t let her get you like that! Thus you give chase. For a fairy that’s not fit, she’s quite fast alright! Faster than you had imagined, but she’s still no match for a trained squirrel like you. Before long, you managed to snatch her out of the air. You plan on having her go through your most rigorous training program now. To your surprise though, the fairy is actually laughing.[/p]

[p][fae]“That’s more like it,”[/fae] she cheers. “Again! Again!”[/p]

[p]“That’s enough of you!” you say, getting really quite tired now, “I should turn you into my sweatband!” You start using your magic to do just that. To your surprise, she is not struggling at all. Her arms stretch out, as do her legs. Her hands and feet connect as a result as her body turns into fabric. Her wings retreat back into her body and her bodily features vanish as she transform. Soon, you have in your hands a blue sweatband with a fairy print on it. Smiling at your handiwork, you instantly put her on your head and decide to go back to the treadmill.[/p]

[p]“Now I’ll put you to good use!” you say with a grin as you start running again, on your way to finishing up that marathon. All that time, it feels as if you are actually even more energetic than before. With each new mile, you even more invigorated than before. Is this because of your new headband? Whatever the case, you’ve never felt so alive before! After finishing the marathon distance, you turn of the treadmill.[/p]

[p]“Whew, that was fun!” you say out loud. That’s when you feel the headband turning itself back again. In just a few moments, Jewdewfae managed to turn back to her old body again, with little trouble.[/p]

[p][fae]“Agreed!”[/fae] she says with a broad smile, [fae]“but now I’ll go do something else. Thanks, Biggie! I’ll see ‘ya around!”[/fae]  Before you can even react to that though, the fairy already zips off, on her way to her next playmate. You’re not really sure what to make of that fairy. At least you got a good workout out of it...[/p]', N'[p][fae]“Hrmpf,”[/fae] Jewdewfae grunts, folds her arms and turns around.

At first you’re unable to find the source, spotting no other humans (or animals, or combination thereof) amongst the old wooden pews or at the altar--not even inside the confessional booths.  Something warm and wet suddenly drops on your arm and you look up.  Finally you spot the source of the crying--a tiny winged woman perched atop a bell hanging from the ceiling.  Jewdewfae.[/p]

[p][fae]”Oh, hiya down there,”[/fae] Jewdewfae sighs glumly, sliding down the slope of the bell, growing to the body of a full sized woman as she falls, landing lightly on the ground in front of you.  She wears a long white wedding dress instead of her regular sky-blue one, its ruffled skirt trailing on the floor, the fabric spotless and pristine.  She carries a fresh bouquet of roses in her gloved hands, the flowers still wet from the morning’s dew. [fae] “Tell me, have you ever been married before?  From the looks of it--probably not.  No offense, Biggie.  We Elder Fae, we don’t have any tradition of marriage.  I’m missin’ out!  To have someone to hold and love for your whole life long…”[/fae]  Jewdewfae begins to sniffle again.

She wipes away the tears from her cheek with the back of her gloved hands.  [fae]”My beautiful fiancee!  I’ve been waiting for so long for you to come, oh lightta’ my life, jewel of my eyes,  fire of my lions!  Or is that loins?  Doesn’t matter!  Come on!”[/fae][/p]

[p]Jewdewfae grabs your hand and drags you up to the altar, both of your wedding dresses dragging on the ground behind you, gathering dust balls and grime in the process (someone really needs to clean this place… the first thing you’ll do with your new wife is to insist on hiring a maid, that’s for certain!).  Your veil and tiara nearly slip off your head in the fairy’s rush and your breasts nearly pop out of your dress, but you hardly mind--this is the big moment you’ve been waiting for![/p]

[p][fae]“Do you, um… Mrs. Biggie, take me to be your lawfully wedded wife?”[/fae] Jewdewfae asks, gazing deep into your eyes.  Your cheeks tingle with your intense blush, your heart racing a mile a minute, your panties already soaking wet with the anticipation of your first bedding.[/p]

[p]“I do,” you answer, scarcely able to withhold your intense joy.[/p]

[p][fae]“Do you… me… Jewdewfae, take this Biggie to me your… my… lawfully wedded wife?”[/fae] Jewdewfae continues.  [fae]“Yes!  Yes, I do!  I may now kiss the bride!”[/fae][/p]

[p]You shut your eyes and lean in, waiting to feel your new wife’s sweet lips against your own, the kiss that will forever confirm your love.  Your mind is already racing to plan out your honeymoon--a sunny beach down in the tropics?  A ski resort high up in the mountains?  Maybe a tour around the entire world.  And then you’ll settle down in a nice mansion with white paint, servants and maids, a giant feather bed… and then there will be children… a lot of children!  The mansion will echo with their laughter, and together you and your wife will watch them grow up and move out and retire to--[/p]

[p]You jolt backwards, your face suddenly covered with icing, globs of chocolate breading face tumbling down and soiling your wedding dress, crumbs falling down between your breasts.  You wipe the icing off your face in disbelief, your hopes and dreams shattered… shattered by a slice of chocolate cake.  You stand there with your mouth agape, paralyzed.[/p]

[p][fae]“Gotcha!”[/fae] Jewdewfae laughs, her tiny tongue licking some icing off your cheek.  Her white wedding dress lies empty on the ground and she is back in her regular fairy body, flying back up to the bell as she nibbles on an icing flower. [fae] “‘Yer funny, Biggie!

You’re about to turn to the corner out of her sight when you suddenly hear her speak.[/p]

[p][fae]“Psssst!  Hey you!”[/fae]  The woman suddenly jumps to her feet, knocking her chair backward, and pulls open her trench coat to reveal that she’s wearing nothing underneath.  Based on the faintly glowing blue tattoos on her body, you figure that she’s Jewdewfae in disguise.[/p]

[p]“...yes?” you ask.  “What is it?”[/p]

[p]Jewdewfae looks down at her body, then back at you.  [fae]“Arentcha’ surprised, Biggie?  I’m not wearing any clothes!  I’m in the buff!  I’m wearin’ my birthday outfit!”[/fae][/p]

[p]Jewdewfae shrinks down to her fairy size and zooms right at you, a blue blur heading straight for your crotch.  Before you have time to react, you feel something warm and wet slip around your cock and vanish, a sudden jolt of pleasure that nearly brings you to orgasm.  You peer down past your breasts and watch your cock grow out a half dozen centimeters more, pulsing with waves of sensitivity that keep it as erect as an iron bar, your balls itching to release some of your pent up cum.  Already you feel your thighs quiver, aching for a man or woman between them, someone to plant your meaty cock into.  But you know you no matter how hard you try, you simply won’t be able to get off without the look of genuine surprise on someone’s face.[/p]

[p]In just a few minutes of walking you’re at the Pump-N-Dash (Car Wash) where a couple of tired girls with their t-shirts discarded due to the day’s insufferable heat are washing a red sports car by hand.  “Pssst!” you hiss, throwing open your trench coat with a shit-eating grin.[/p]

[p][fae]“Ugh!  What’s wrong with people?”[/fae] Jewdewfae groans.  [fae]“One more try!  There’s this one old lady who lives in the Oldoak Apartment Building; let’s go try her!  She’s sure ‘ta scream!”[/fae][/p]

[p]You trot back up the road until you arrive at the apartments.  Sure enough, there is an elderly woman feeding the pigeons outside at the dog park, her yippy little chihuahua snapping at the birds without actually deterring them in the slightest.  “Hey, old lady!” you shout.[/p]

[p]“Yes, dearie?”[/p]

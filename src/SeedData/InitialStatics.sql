Others appear as simple three to four feet tall versions of their little and curious fairy sisters. Great Fairies are mysterious and powerful entities that wield indeterminable magic, which is fueled and limited only by their own feelings and imaginations. This chaotic magic is a gift by their bond with Mother Nature. There are several ways to attain the station of a Great Fairy. Either a fairy lives long enough to be regarded and worshiped as a leader and teacher of their vast knowledge and through that is granted the gift of greatness from her sisters, or she sets out on an adventure and achieves a state of mind that lets her obtain an indeterminable amount of magic prowess herself. Seldomly this gift can be received as a show of good will by the Fae towards beings of great power, purity and poise. Great Fairies are benevolent and often bless the unfortunate with gifts, while those with evil intentions make prime candidates for their punishments. Like all fairies, Great Fairies are constantly attracted by every form of creativity and by instances of deep feeling that they want to share. Fairies are naturally complicated, and their behavior is ruled by a moral code that is very different from that of humans. It is of primary importance that you treat them with kindness and all due respect, especially if you deal with a Great Fairy. Otherwise they may easily be offended and punish you accordingly.

Darkened eyes, or horns, or pale skin, or just a disturbing vibe that others cannot quite put their finger on. They can take on the appearance of Great Fairies in all their forms - but the difference will be obvious when compared side by side with the real deal. Dark Fae are best defined as the mysterious and dangerous versions of their already chaotic Great Fairy counterparts. Dark Fae wield wild magicks, limited only by their own feelings and imaginations. This chaotic magic is a gift granted by their eternal bond to the Sidhe - the mysterious Otherworld of their birth.  Many have hypothesized that Dark Fae are nothing more than the corrupted form of a Great Fairy, but the truth is much more complicated. All fairies exist along a range of light and darkness, and a Dark Fae merely represents one extreme. They are more likely to attack without provocation than their lighter brethren, and their mischief is not limited by whether or not their targets are deserving of punishment. Dark Fae are compulsive, unpredictable, and in terms of human morals... evil. They respect power, and will grant gifts to those they feel worthy of it..

Wandering eyes would be sure to fall upon the most adorable of felines. With a svelte build and pleasing hips, one might pin the fluff-ball to be a cat-girl. Closer inspection seems to shatter that expectation, though, as certain pieces and mannerisms seem a touch off. Upon that realization, the boy seems to discover the stares as heterochromatic eyes turn to return the gaze. With the motion, a trail of sparkles trail behind him as the light manages to glisten from his silken, powder white fur and his fluffy feathered wings. The longer his gaze is returned, the longer that initial angelic poise seems to deteriorate. Across his lips crosses a catty smirk, his little ears dancing atop his head in accent. In those eyes is a certain arrogant, if rather playful twinkle. While the sparkle seems in line with the adorable theme, that less-than-innocent grin said something else. It was hard to pry eyes away from his return stare, the focus attempting to draw one in. One might feel like a toy under the attention, but it was easy to break with enough concentration. The struggling seems to cause a delightful giggle from the feline. Who knows what kind of thoughts might be fluttering about in his pretty little head. It would take a bit longer for the after-effects of his look to pass, leaving anyone susceptible to falling into it again. Yet, as if visual lures weren''t enough, other senses could be easy prey for additional traps. The boy''s body carries a rather pleasant scent of roses, its tendrils tickling upon the nose. The flowery perfumes only seem to grow more intoxicating the longer one stays in their presence, threatening to sink their claws prey. It might be smart to take a step back instead of falling into those clutches. Of course, his own look and effects could turn into a double-edged sword for him. 

While he might be picky or even standoffish, pressing the right buttons were prone to leave him in his own vulnerable state. While he might never admit to it, he seems to suffer himself from the caveats of being a feline. Counter to his impulsive and picky nature, he has a soft-stop for belly rubs, ear scritchings, beams of sun-light, and certain types of substances, toys, and fish.

A red-skinned woman, dressed in unusually bulky clothes as if she were hiding something, puts in a decent performance; but then a catgirl performs so poorly that one of the judges has to tell another not to be cruel. A young vampire Childe, sparking in the stage lights, clutches her ominous looking teddy bear throughout her number. The show goes on for some time. And it hits you - you could make a better singer than all of these women!  In your opinion, even though she did not win, the best singer by a wide margin was a shy drow maiden - so in her honor, you decide to construct your spell so that your new diva will also be ... Elvish.', NULL, NULL, NULL, N'full', N'live', 1)

Whereas some of the springs still show signs of magical corruption and arcane fallout of the wars in this cataclysmic town, the ambience of its sheltered northern offspring presents itself yet immaculate and serene. Regardless, all your little digression has wrought is just trees and then some. Paired with the humid air of the neighbouring springs, a whole army of bloodthirsty insects keeps attacking you at every step you take below this thick foliage that shields the narrow path you had stumbled over a while ago. The reason why you began this journey has already escaped you. Mayhap you heard a strange noise, peradventure you hoped to find a rare relic, haply you had just a feeling or belike you interpreted the path as a road to a rare dating spot. Whatever the reason, after a perceived donation of half your blood in honor of the local wildlife, be it mosquitos, ticks or other horrors that you can imagine, you finally stand at the end of your road. It isn''t an end and certainly not your goal per se, just another choice in life after another overcome ordeal. And after regretting the last choice each step of your way, this one doesn''t seem any more compelling. Yet, all your sacrifices and effort have been in vain if you are to turn around now.
One of the branching paths in front of you leads off to the right into what seems to be your own silver lining on the horizon, an oddly large clearing filled with the most beautiful flowers you think you ever will see. Whilst the other leads down an even more narrow path down to hell, another bunch of even more and suspiciously cooped and bundled up trees. Not that you came for a bouquet of wild flowers, but that option does suddenly sound like a nice trade-off for going home. Worse, the trees themselves don’t really look out of place. There is nothing here and no need to investigate further. They’re just like any other tree in the Scarlet Forest, most likely ridden with dozens of hungry monsters that try to suck you dry in the afternoon. And then there was the danger of being assaulted in a narrow space while being exhausted and itchy. Damn, the insect bites could drive anyone insane and they surely tampered with your ability to concentrate by now.
As though to meet your troubles halfway, an estranged whisper inside the twigs and branches of the trees catches your interest on your way to the flowers and a sudden gust of wind animates a small dust devil in front of the clearing to dance around your feet. For a moment you consider it to be a trick by a fellow mage, to distract you from their presence in the woods. Ready to defend yourself, you ignore the beauty of the vortex that begins to slowly die off at your feet and face the suspicious murder of trees. Nothing happens for a while and you shake your head in disbelief. This whole adventure clearly started to go to your head. The second you turn your back to the trees and face the clearing again to collect your price for the day, another group of those high-pitched voices is heard, and you feel like someone or something is attempting to lure you deeper into the grove. Unable to ignore your own safety and leave your back exposed, you decide to investigate the matter further and close in on the trees. 
You suppose that you will just have to work your way through the trees, something that will be quite difficult for you, seeing as you’re much too big for most of the gaps. And you certainly don''t have all the time or patience in the world currently! You look around and find the best way to approach this hurdle is an opening between what seems like a wanton aligned gate of trees. That is a good place to start. Then again, it could simply be a freak of nature. The moment you start to crawl through the hole in the trees though, you can feel a strange sensation overcoming you. A kind of tugging on your mind, beckoning you back out and away from here. You ignore it and press on, expecting yet another defense from the hidden mage. And soon the feeling vanishes and gets replaced with a growing urge to enter the grove and stay there, strange. But before you can contemplate what is happening to you, a strange force grabs your shoulders and lifts you off the ground. Like a vortex, the strange wind spins you around and high up into the air, all the while carrying you out off and away from the grove and the clearing, only to drop you from two meter in height right into a little thicket of thorns. That''s it, that''s really it! You stand up and remove the leaves from your clothes, as well as several thorns. While less painful than directly breaking a fall on the ground, the pricking thorns and their throbbing holes quickly remind you of another generous blood donation you just did for the wildlife, whilst small red dots sully your garments.
Exhausted and still unable to spot the perpetrator, you visibly shake your head at the murder of trees and just decide to give it a rest, yes leave the place altogether. Damn those trees, damn those insects, and yes, even damn those tempting flowers. May the dust devil or better yet a tornado tear them all away. Even as you leave, the voices don''t stop. For a moment you consider shielding your ears the rest of the way, however, this time the ambient noise doesn''t ring out alien and convoluted, but rather as an argument, hardly more than a bickering that continuously picks up in volume. A short glance in the twilight of nightfall reveals to you two small lights, one red and another one yellow. Intrigued you decide to listen in on the voices with a little amplification spell.
„Why did you stop me? You were the one wanting to keep the biggie away?“, the yellow one protested from above another branch before descending. „From my precious flowers“, the red one countered, „there was no reason to trap them here.“ „So you instead decided to break the biggies neck?“, the yellow one teased. „There was a brush.“ The red fae answered with a sullen inflection. „Nice brush sis''! This one only knows one color, red. I always knew you had a dark side.“ „If you like my dark side so much, how about you stay here for the day, as an ivy!“ Without warning, the red fairy seems to shot a pink light at her sister, who quickly dodged it with a surprise headstart. With a strange display of an aerial magic battle – fairly one sided – the two seem to slowly move away. The yellow one just keeps evading the red one and mocking her, all the while giggling. And soon the other fae falls back into her cheery sisters demeanor. These Fae are crazy!
With the two vanished from sight and yourself returning on your personal path of perdition, you can''t stop thinking about the illusive figure the red fairy seems to have used to save you from a fate worse than a pile of roses and the accompanying voices that nearly drove you mad. Thus, an idea forms in your head. 
A nature spirit of wind, a sylph as they call them, could nearly drive one insane chasing after a shadow or save you when you are in a pinch. Oh the things such a magical force of nature could do to your enemies if it became serious! Yes, you need an illusive yet alluring magical figure that mocks your enemies wherever they dare to tread. And maybe, just maybe, you could get another of your enemies to play the mocking part. All you need is to come up with a plan on how to mold the inherent power of another mage into an essence of pure wind. Ouch! Or maybe you should wait until you are home. Another swarm of mosquitos has just found their way to your bleeding husk. ', NULL, NULL, NULL, N'full', N'live', 1)

Driven by your inherent inquisitiveness, you leave the certain path of the boardwalk. But the clinging mire and the sopping moisture soon begin to gradually wear down your will, and you become weary. Only now do you realize that the way back had long since been swallowed by the quagmire. Tired and shaken, you cling to your only hope of survival, a strange blue light that lures you further and further away. 
Trance-like, you arrive at a glade that is composed of a heart-warming sea of flowers between ancient trees. Several stone circles rest at the feet of the trees and hint at the hidden presence of their creators. And finally, the colourful lights of the local Fae pour into the flowery meadow, and you catch sight of an even greater presence among them.
Wafting regal and raised, a three to four feet high female figure of light and belle approaches your smitten form and opens her arms wide. Your exhausted mind can''t fathom the entity before you, but a feeling of warmth and comfort enwraps your body, as the surrounding fairies'' and their guardian''s magic restore your vigour to its former glory.
A brazen yet emphatic voice addresses you: "Sunnyglade has fallen prey to the Chaos. Yet from the Chaos can also arise a first. Many a sinful mage has misused their gift of creativity to sully the world and spread their stigmas. Hence, I have chosen you, to avenge this wickedness and to retune the power of their imaginations to the inherent harmony of nature. Find all those whose hearts are still alive, and plead them to guide their and my sisters. Find all those whose spirits have been shattered and mend them, so that they may mend the pain of their peers. And find all those whose hearts have been cast into the dark and redeem them, so that they may find their souls once again. It is time that the festering malice transforms back into a joyful inspiration, that the frequent terror yields to a heartfelt laughter and that the tragedy of war embraces a rekindled love for one another. Now go and be the herald of our Midsummer''s Eve!“
Her light grows brighter and brighter until you have to close your eyes. And once her shine vanishes, you open them back up to see yourself standing at the same dead and rotting extension of the boardwalk you started.

Many of those games seem rather useless in a town like Sunnyglade and some of them are just absurd. You see dungeon crawler like D&D and TDA or card games like Magick – The Gathering. But here and there you see absurd interpretations or hybrids of those. One particular is called Sand of Hate, and it seems to be quite popular. At least the shelves are empty. A man chuckles loudly and you turn your gaze to a sinister corner of the room. A hooded figure with their face hidden behind a rag of cloth stares you in the eyes, but quickly averts them to face a newcomer; a man in a strange leather armour and with shaven red hair. He sits down and places a deck in front of him. „You keep coming back, there is strength in that.“ The hooded figure proclaims and they start anew. Cards hover in the air, get mixed and then get dealt. For some reason your vision fades to black and you can''t see anything that unfolds behind the sudden shroud anymore.
When you turn around you regain your sight, just to rest on another group of people sitting around another table. Nothing seems out of the ordinary. They have normal clothes, no apparitions hover over their character sheets and the whole room doesn''t change under the gamemasters command. You remain close, but hide your presence and interest. Shouldn''t something happen? Time passes and all they do is put down figurines of strange creatures on a hex board while shouting weird rules and numbers at each other. Are they really just playing a tabletop game? This is madness! This is Sunnyglade! People don''t do that here... A living tabletop was just outside of their door. Hell, it is in  just another corner! 
You finally decide to step in and question their weird behavior. And maybe how those ''normal'' people managed to remain human for so long. They make prime candidates for targets like this.
Hailing them from afar, you strike a conversation with them about this. Once you mention their ''normal'' state, the whole atmosphere changes to your surprise the closer you get. The normal clothes of the players slowly change to garments that mimic their character sheets and the gamemaster turns into some kind of evil lich, the main antagonist you heard about before. The table falls silent and the gamemaster turns towards you. His empty skull holes filled with cold blue spheres tear at your soul. And his form is only shrouded by a living black robe, tattered and worn. You take a quick glance to your sides, but the room is gone and you are in some kind of obsidian tower. Was the gaming group a trap? A threatening voice that shakes the world you have entered resonates in your core. „Suddenly, the gate springs open and the last barrier between the demon plane and the world of the living is destroyed. The whole room descends into a crimson light and the last traces of the material plane vanish as the ground is shrouded in writhing onyx smoke.“ The whole room adapts to his words and you hear a faint sound of a die being rolled. „A pain grasps at their body and they can''t help but buckle over. Hot, sulfurous smoke lingers around them and travels up and down their throat while they choke. An unnatural heat starts to emanate from their back and they can already feel the outside cling to their body.“ In panic you are able to regain some control over your body and gasp in relief as you have not become the image the lich had described. „Then they stumble back onto their feet, relieved that they have not been corrupted by the Outside. Yet, the great lich Amor''thall never lured them here to be part of his new realm, but to feed the Outsiders behind them!“ The dooming cackle of the lich is heard, as a force sends you to the ground. You force yourself to turn around and behind you is a huge warhorse paint in the darkest black. Oozing hot sulfuric ichor drips from its snout and burns your clothes below its huge flaming mane. With the hot, sulfurous smoke directly in your face, you can hardly recognize the adventures that came to your rescue. Apparently already too late to safe you, the beast hails its own arrival with a life threatening shriek and its bursting flames quickly take over the whole room. Unable to bear this pain, you pass out.
When you awake, you are still in the gaming room, but this time resting on the table. A man gently awakes you and smiles warmly. You startle up, realizing who he is. The lich''s human face does nothing to avert the dread he put you through. With a strong grasp on your back he pushes you back in your seat and a thronging voice accompanies a character sheet and a player''s handbook he puts on the table. „Never underestimate a gamer''s fantasy. Next time you should make sure you can take the heat.“ He leaves you alone, distraught and broken. And somehow you feel empty. Not like he had taken part of your soul, but like something needs to be finished. You grab the book and sheet and try to fill out the blanks. Then you storm the shelf to look for another version of his ''Dungeon Master''s Guide''. You can not wait to settle the score with this monstrosity. If their game is called off for now, you will just make your own.', NULL, NULL, NULL, N'full', N'live', 1)

Seven remarkably unchanged humans - five ... no, six male, one female, sit at them in a row, staring into their fluorescent screens.  Most appear to be in their early twenties, though the female is surely pushing the border of twenty-nine, while one of the men must be north of thirty-five. From their behavior, you quickly gather that they are engaged in a ''raid'', in one of those massively multiplayer online role playing games. Each appears to be speaking into a headset, suggesting they are not the only members taking part in this virtual endeavor, but merely a part of a larger team fighting an array of technological dragons, to slowly upgrade the imaginary gear of their online avatars.
The first and left-most member of the party is unusually large, strong and muscular for the type of person you would expect to engage in such endeavors. Alone of the six players, his body type might be well suited to the virtual adventure - provided, of course, that he is able to equip fine magical arms and armors, and is assisted by a noble healer. If you were to change his form, it would be into one of the city''s mighty minotaurs; strong, able to stand up to all sorts of punishment, unyielding in his approach to tank his adversaries head-on.
The second member of the group could not be more different. A small, wiry man, with an air of impatience and condescension on his face; you constantly hear him yelling at the group to hurry up, to perform up to his exacting standards - even though a look at the monitor reveals that his character has been lying unconscious on the ground for the majority of this virtual raid. "Hurry up!" he says, "Time is money, and I need my phat lewtz!" You picture changing him, into a small, greedy, arrogant man; perhaps one of those goblins you''ve seen roaming about the streets. Wait, aren''t they all female? Well, he''ll just have to adapt then, won''t he?
The third in line is a gaunt, pale fellow; dressed in a style that many of today''s youth would refer to as Gothic, despite having little to do with that millenia-old barbarian tribe. His face is white, drawn, with a life-weary expression looking out from his black-robed form; you suspect he is playing some sort of damned spell caster - a warlock, or a priest of the shadows, or simply a wizard with a sour disposition. You consider changing him as well - perhaps a nice zombie slave, or to add him to the ranks of the nosferatu.
The fourth appears to be nearly as athletic as the first, though while your erstwhile minotaur is strong, he seems considerably more agile. You just can''t picture him as a warrior, weapons and armor in tow - he seems more like one to fight with his own body, perhaps as a kung-fu master. Or - are they calling them monks now? That makes sense, from the perspective of the Eastern tradition; though the word has always made you think more of Franciscan Friars, hunched over illuminated manuscripts, writing in their cramped cells by candlelight.  But what to transform him into ... perhaps an anthropomorphic panda?  No, that would just be silly.
Instead, you turn your gaze to the fifth member of the group, the man significantly older than the others. A bit of a mischievous expression in his eye, you suspect that this one, and perhaps only this one, has engaged in the vice of transformative magic that has been sweeping through the town of late. His online avatar likely reflects this - perhaps he plays a wily shape-changer himself, taking on the world as a lion, or a tiger, or a bear. Or a tree, or an anthropomorphic chicken fighting with mystical lasers. You consider what to make of him; he seems to laugh the most of any of his companions; a real troll amongst the group.  Hmm.
You then examine the party''s penultimate member, the one who''s gender seemed a bit indeterminate on initial inspection. Quiet, a bit shy, this man - for man he is, on closer inspection, despite an effeminate face and slim build - you can imagine he must be the group''s healer; selflessly forfeiting the ability to directly take down all virtual threats in favor of keeping his compatriots alive, using his magic solely to boost the other warrior''s health, preventing them from giving up the ghost and falling to the imaginary beasts the group of them are challenging. His body is so slim, you cannot picture turning him into anything but an elf; as it so happens, the spell you know already creates a sylvan creature of indeterminate sex, so that he will not feel left out.
And finally, you come to the last member of the group, the sole female. Despite her diminutive stature and decades of established gender roles in the hobby of gaming, she seems to be both the group leader, and by far the most bloodthirsty. She screams into the headset, or occasionally to one of her compatriots sitting there in person, about how if they only tried harder, they''d have downed the boss already. "Get to center!" she yells; "That''s a 50 dkp minus for not knowing what the fuck to do!" Her composure reeks an aura of command, of strength, of dominance - she seems by far the most worthy of your attention, giving her a body far more worthy of her personality. Still female, but strong, muscular - capable of charging blindly into battle, dual war-axes held high overhead, prepared to cleave all she meets in twain. Yes, what this town truly needs is more Orc Warrioresses, and your new spell will truly help unleash the power of the horde.', NULL, NULL, NULL, N'full', N'live', 1)

Our recent experiments with submerging mice in goo have shown that the mice are much less likely to resist if the goo has been mixed with a newly (re)discovered substance. Not only does the substance render the mouse incapacitated, like other promising goo additives, but the mice themselves will, after being rescued from drowning in goo, gladly seek it out again. Since all mice used in this experiment used to be human, we are confident that up-scaled and weaponized goo will have the same effect on actual humans.

Several weak blue lights flicker through the foliage of the foreboding trees and soon pique your interest. But as you try to make your way through the menacing plant life, they suddenly start to move and their several small branches assault you like a group of weird tentacles. Unable to break their assault, you are pushed back and decide to find another way towards your goal. Now that it wants to keep you out, you most definitely want to get in. 
Thus you keep to the left side of the willow wall and slowly enter an even thicker fog on your way south. And once most of the willows vanish behind the fog, you decide to use the moment to quickly break through their potential shield. But you fail again. Quickly the willows entangle you and hold you back, now even blocking your retreat. And once you actually try to get back out, they suddenly throw you inside of them. With the sudden throw and the wet and slippery ground, it seems like a miracle that you manage to land safely on your feet and tumble the rest of your way, stopping just in front of a dangerous pond inside this weird place. A sudden shadow comes out from the water, engulfed by it like a natural skin. Clad in water, the shadow-like head of a horse tries to reach for you with a bite, but fails. All of a sudden, several wisps appear, reminding you of the actual souls that may still linger; all those that have fallen victim to the beast you just evaded. Shocked, you stumble back, only to be mocked by a high-pitched voice: "Don''t mind him, he hasn''t had a good meal in a long time. And with the willows normally keeping people out on our request, they rarely feed him nowadays." You turn around to see... nothing. While the fog has cleared somewhat in the center of the trees, you don''t see another soul until another call from her leads you to a little person of about five inches sitting on a big amanita shroom by the pond, gently flapping her butterfly wings. "So let us attend the matter at hand. I let you in for free, but can you give me a good reason to let you back out?"
While her threat might be serious, you aren''t certain if you should fear one little fae. Still you are hooked, filled to the brim with interest about her ''invitation''. You decide to amuse her and accept to listen to her proposal. You soon see that she actually is sitting in a sea of amanita mushrooms, lined up in irregular patterns around the southern pasture of the pond. And several of the amanitas seem to have mutated, with distorted small speckles at their sides now glaring demon-like horns and several other mushrooms further growing in warped shapes. "You see, this town''s atmosphere is perfect to raise one of my people''s most beloved species, the amanita." She gently caresses the cap of the shroom she sits on. "And this special place serves as our fertilizer so to speak. With all the exhilarating emotions floating around here and the exciting thoughts of the people inside this blessed town, our babies are well fed and ready to spore. All we have to do is guide the magic and emotions they absorbed." She keeps on talking about her people and their babies. You gently divert your eyes and scan the surroundings for any of her sisters. If she has support, even a little fae could become a pest. But you find nothing in your quick search, and with her hands clapped together in front of her chest, she starts to smile and continues. "But being a parent is more or less a full time occupation, and neither I nor most of my servants can leave our fields unattended. So I wanted to propose an exchange. We entrust you with the potent spores of our hard labor and in return you find the most powerful mages in the town and send them here to join us. I am confident our gift will prove to be quite helpful to you in any further attempts to attain ascendancy in your town''s petty tournament. And in return, I am not only willing to let you out, but I will further call back any of my servants that plan to prank or assault you. This includes all the new servants you send my way." 
You halt your wandering thoughts and actually start to comprehend her proposition. This group of fae seems bent on expanding their own power base inside this town and abusing an apparently corrupted and magically charged mushroom to infect others with spores, which might or might not turn them into slaves or pixies themselves. Bolstering this faction might seem feasible, but even a swarm of bees can take out a bear. Yet, you have the feeling she won''t take no for your answer. And while you might suffer her retaliation later on, at least you could do so on neutral ground. Thus you accept her idea with honesty, but should it turn out to be ominous, you may just escape and betray her later. For now, you mean it. And maybe you will actually send one or two their way. "Then we are in agreement. But be careful not to squander this gift." She lifts her hand and a magical fog rises from the ground. Soon the menacing grey turns into an even more menacing yellow, as it soaks itself in the spores of the amanitas all around you. Even so you remain calm and you ready an elemental spell to blow it away if need be. But the smile that returns to the pixie''s face betrays her seemingly evil intent, even though all her teeth are visible in a menacing manner. Suddenly the spore laden fog clutters at one point and gets covered by layers of dead leaves that form a small purse. Afterwards the little fae clenches her left fist in front of her face and blows into it to reveal a black pearl that floats towards you. "Take this pearl of crystallized tea as a gift. If you suck on it prior to extended contact with our spores, it will prevent any negative side effects. Of course its use is limited and it needs to be replaced after a time. And should you fail to deliver on your promise, it will shatter on my moment''s notice. So go now; mug them, kiss them, drug them, fuck them. Get rid of whomever stands in your way. With the pearl you won''t fail by a lack of choice. Decide for yourself, but deliver. And should my scouts report your failure, see to yourself. We shadows stay true to our nature as we hide from the light and banish countless souls into the black depths of reality. For we are Unseelie, everywhere but never seen. And we never shy away to use our gifts for ourselves." 
You quickly pocket her gifts and give her your best attempt to fake interest in a prolonged partnership in this town''s affairs. But neither her nor you are really convinced by your act. All she does is laugh and point towards the wall of willows that bends to her will and offers you passage. Before you can escape, the trees and mushrooms start to laugh at you as one after another more and more pixies and other fae appear around them from out of nowhere. Spooked, you reconsider her statement from before and quickly run to the exit, stumbling twice and dirtying up your clothes with mud, only to be accompanied by the fae''s extended gloats. At least at this place they certainly are everywhere. And if you are honest, you are glad if they are nevermore to be seen. Maybe if you make three or four new servants it will suffice and they will leave you alone? For now, all you can do is run and find some honey to appease this swarm of bees.', NULL, NULL, NULL, N'full', N'live', 1)

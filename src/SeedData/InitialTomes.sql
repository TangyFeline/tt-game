<i>You open the paperback book and begin to read the notes inside, squinting a little as you notice that the pages are all handwritten before simply being photocopied into this book The following is the salvaged investigation by Kiara Galaway, a reporter who went missing on April 12, 2015 on the outskirts of Sunnyglade on the property of one Donna Milton.</i>

My name is Kiara Galaway and I have been charged with collecting information on Donna Milton on behalf of the Weekly Babble Newspaper. I have been waiting outside the house for a few hours now and finally notice that a young teenager has left for town. I believe that is Donna''s niece but I am unsure. She seems to be the only one in the house at the moment so I am taking my opportunity to sneak inside. 

I have made it inside the house and it.....looks oddly normal for all the rumors I have heard about this place and the family. I only took this job because I am looking for my friend Nicole, who disappeared on this farm a few weeks ago. But I will find out what these sick people have done with the missing people. 

After a little searching I have found an old diary in the master bedroom. After I skimmed through it I have come to realize that Donna Milton is crazy! I am copying pages from the diary into my report now. 

<hr>

Dear Diary,
It''s Donna again......Aunt Circe is so mean sometimes. She changed me into a hen for a week because we were out of eggs for breakfast on monday morning. I do not think I will ever learn how to control my magic with how much she changes me into an animal. I have so many blank spaces in my memory that I think I have been spending more time as a beast then as a human. But she insists this is something I must learn....that if I am going to do this to others I must know how it feels myself. Anyways today is my fifteenth birthday and I was given the day off so that is a good thing at least. Anyways dearest diary I am off to make dinner. 

<b>Donna Milton, 1893</b> 

Dear Diary,
After 100 years of training the day finally came. Aunt Circe is giving me the mantle of Circe...the ranch....all the livestock....everything. She asked me to change her into a cow to seal the ritual so I did as she asked with a final goodbye. I took her to her new home in the pasture and branded her like all the other cows, I can''t believe I was sad to see her freely give up her humanity and mind to pass me the power of Circe. But I understand she has lived a very long time and that she was tired of watching the world progress while she still felt like the young goddess of Greek mythology. I am sad to see her go but I am happy to know that she is now happier with her simple existence. 

<b>Donna Milton 1993</b> 

Dear Diary,
I forgot I had this dusty old thing. Ever since my last entry I forgot I threw this in the attic with all of.....Aunties old things. Circine moved in today and Aunty was right. I felt the passage of magic in her body as she changed her entire gym class into animals. She was angry and didn''t have any control. I couldn''t even change them back after I put her to sleep. Oh well new livestock is welcome on the ranch and mabye one day we can turn them all back. However I must start her training because I can tell that eventually she will be the one to take the mantle from my shoulders. I truely hope she won''t come to hate me as I used to hate my Aunty. 

<b>Donna Milton 2014</b> 


Do you see what I mean? She is absolutely nuts! She thinks she is over a hundred years old and....oh shit, someone just came into the house! 


<i>As you continue to read you notice the handwriting is slowly growing sloppier.</i> 

It was Donna! She came in and simply looked at me with a cross expression until she saw the diary in my hands. She demanded to know why I broke into her house but I managed to run out the open window. I am hiding in the barn now and...I feel strange. I have two bumps on my head and my breasts feel....full 

<i>You notice the writing grows sloppier</i> 

So hot....took off my clothes....fur is nice and... Wait what is wrong with me!? My breasts are.....moving down my belly and turning into....an udder? I...I feel so hot and I need to play with myself....no...I need a billy goat to. GROSS! Where did that thought come from! 

<i>The handwriting becomes scribbles with only a few readable word.</i>

Help! Hooves hard write...need breed...need billy....not goat I...human 

<i>You gulp nervously as a very practice hand wrote a few notes on the bottom of the page.</i>

<b><i>I never turn down a guest, but please make sure you are invited before coming to my home and breaking in or you will end up like me newest nanny goat. I can hear her now as she is being bred by one of my finest billy goats. So please stop by, but be respectful or you will be the one baa''ing mindlessly!

<b>April 17</b>.  Fate is a cruel mistress!  Today I lost my last two guides in this cursed fog--this ethereal mist that soaks our very bones, clog our throats, suffocates and blinds us pitiful fools!  When the fog set in this morning, we lost all sense of direction save a few short rays of sun that broke through the endless clouds, but this did us no help as we all swore it came from a different direction in the sky!  We began to hear childish giggles in the trees, just out of sight, enough to drive the most learned scholar mad!  And drive the guides mad they did.  The grown men, skilled trackers that they were, dashed off to catch our unseen watchers.  I shouted until my throat was hoarse, but I dared not journey off the trail lest I find myself ensnared by the strange allure!  I heard nothing of them again.  By the time the fog lifted it was late in the evening.  I found their canteens, backsacks, compasses--all their survival gear discarded by the riverside by lantern light, along with their vests and trousers as if they had splashed into the waters like children at play.  Now I am alone, and I must rest.  I shall not turn back, I cannot.

<b>April 22</b>.  My supply of hardtack and jerky is exhausted.  I could have sworn I had another package of dried goods sealed tightly up in the leather sack, but now that I look I cannot find it.  I have not seen a living soul in this wilderness since the fog stole away my guide; the chance of thieves having stolen it are nonexistent.  Still, every now and then I hear a giggle up in a tree, behind a rock, sometimes right behind me!  It must be in my mind, but I cannot help but respond.  I am being watched, followed,  Toyed with...

<b>April 25</b>.  My stomach rumbles and my hand grows weak.  I have not eaten in days except some young roots boiled in water, but they have made me sick to the stomach and I feel less nourished for my efforts.  I lay against a tree, resting my eyes, awaiting the unending sleep that comes to all mortal men.

<b>April 26</b>.  A miracle!  Or perhaps I have perished already?  When I awoke this morning, I found before me a dew-spotted leaf of a plant I have never before seen, green and lush, glowing softly in the dawn as though it held within it its own moon.  Atop it rested a mound of fuschia berries, carrots and mushrooms, leeks and onions.  And to complement it all a silver flask filled with a liquid as thick and sweet and honey!  Greedily I devoured it all, even the minty-flavored leaf upon which it had all been set--a pleasant dessert to finish of the fine feast!.  I looked about for my mysterious benefactor, but apart from the giggles, nothing.  Reinvigorated, I set out once again, a new man with the strength of a stallion in his prime!


<b>May 2</b>.  How can this be?  I have not eaten since the meal placed in front of my sleeping body, not once, yet I have no slowed my pace at all, not foraged for food or even felt the desire to eat!  A simple soak of my feet in this stream is all I need to regain my strength and carry on another few days without rest!  And the light of the sun upon my scalp--oh, the ecstasy!  What is this?  Should I be afraid?  Should I rejoice?  I stand still and listen to gentle trickle of the stream, the chirping of the crickets, the chattering of the birds returning home from their long migratory voyages,  I shut my eyes and an hour passes in moments.  Only when night falls do I seem to come to my senses and continue west on foot.

<b>May 7</b>.  The days grows longer.  The higher the sun rises in the sky, the longer I find myself stunned by its presence, overwhelmed, enveloped,  My toes dig into the earth, my arms reach up to the sky as if to pull the sun closer, the glorious mother, the giver of life...

<b>May 13</b>.  Rooted!  I cannot move!  My body grows tall and slender, my toes grown out into roots slurping up the sweet nutrients of the soil, bark creeping up my shins, my voice growing fainter and more like the rustle of leaves!  Birds perch atop my shoulders.  Not just birds, but small winged women who laugh and poke at me.  Fairies!  When twilight falls I plead with them to stop their taunting and free me from what must be their strange earth magicks, but they do not listen or else do not care, or else dance naked on my outstretched arms and sing hymns to their gods and goddesses upon their new perch.  In a few days what shall remain of me?  Soon I shall be a mere sapling, more conscious than any other but able to do nothing but tilt toward the sun,  It becomes harder to write.  Soon this diary shall fall to the soil and wash away in the rains along with whatever remains of my identity and sanity,  Help!

<i>Editor''s note:  Several pages are lost from the narrative here.  While Sunnyglade scholars and historians have some competing theories as of the events that transpired in this period of time, readers should assume nothing beyond what Mabel herself wrote.  The narrative continues below.</i>

When I awoke the following morning after Jewdewfae had rescued me from my prison of bark, I opened my eyes to find myself laying on my back underneath an all too familiar sight.  I lay slumbering against the wooden trunk in which my conscience had resided for so many eons.  I recognized the familiar partitions of branches, the patterns and knots in the wood, each wounded twig and withered limb whose leaves received only a portion of the sunlight their higher kin stole from the sky.  I shut my eyes and could still feel the tickle of birds'' feet and the ants foraging amongst my roots, following their roads over and underneath my bark.  Was it my imagination?  A delusion?  I was ready to disregard no possibility after all I had seen of this strange land.  Fearing if I focused on the sensations of my previous existence for too long that I would find myself imprisoned there once again, I forced myself to sit upright and clamber to my pale soft feet and resume life among this world''s bipedal inhabitants.

"Good mornin'', Biggie!"  I heard my fae companion greet, though I could not see from where she spoke.  I looked down at myself, a most unfamiliar sight, these womanly curves upon my very own body, the alteration of skin and weight of muscles, bone, and fat to match my new sex.  To my surprise, I realized that I was not naked anymore, a long, thick, warm red dress made of some material like a wolf pelt surrounding and comforting me.

"Hello?" I whispered weakly, the sweet, womanly voice strange to hear from my own throat.  "Where are you?  <i>Who</i> are you?"

Jewdewfae gave no reply at first.  I almost believed she had vanished when I began to feel another draft creeping up along my legs.  I looked down to see my dress growing smaller, parting at the seams yet not tearing as fabric is bound to do.  I sat still and watched as my humble garment shrank down to a small ribbon of cloth around my ankles, then forming into the small winged woman whom I recognized as Jewdewfae.  She had changed herself into the dress to keep me warm!  What strange powers these fae possessed to shift their bodies so effortlessly at will!  I was left naked and exposed with a tiny girl sitting on my toes, staring at me with a warm smile.

"Sooo…" the girl giggled.  "Feeling better?  Wanna know a thing or two about what comes next, Biggie?"

I nodded and the fae began her retelling of all that had transpired.  When I had eaten the strange fruits off of the leaf so long ago, I had fallen for one if the magical traps set by several of Jewdewfae’s sisters, fae of the ancient migratory clan known simply known as the Elders.  I had not been the first to fall victim to their schemes; thousands of unfortunate mortals before me had succumbed to their trickeries over the millennia.  The Elders cared not for mankind encroaching into these virgin lands, ever deeper and more intrusive, feeling forests for our crops and later crushing the grasses with cobblestone roads.  As an explorer and mapper, laying down the routes for generations more to follow, my hired companions and I had made for the most tempting targets for their vengeance.  Jewdewfae had come across some of my former companions while tracking the path of her sisters, but only I had been fortunate enough to be restored to some semblance of my former self.

"How long ago was I changed?" I inquired when she finished her explanation.

"Ummm let’s see…" Jewdewfae circled the tree from which I had emerged, thinking carefully and studying its features.  "Based on how wide and tall you grew I''d guess about a hundred years or so, Biggie," she answered cheerfully.  "You were really growing well!"

A <i>hundred</i>?   Had so many years truly passed?  The realization dawned upon me that the world I had departed remained no longer, not a soul I had known left alive, my children all grown, aged, and perished with only the faint memory of their father.   Just as well, I told myself, once more gazing down at my youthful womanly body.  Could I truly call myself the same Matthias that had embarked on this mission so many years ago?  Perhaps not, but the desire to know of my legacy and the lives of my children, perhaps meet my grandchildren and great children, flooded my mind.

"I thank you for all you have done, but I must return home!" I told the fae, climbing to my feet and sprinting to the east, immediately noticing all of the new female parts of my body which shook and wobbled with each footfall.  I heard Jewdewfae shriek in protest and give chase.

"Hey!  You promised you’d play with me!" she shouted, effortlessly catching up to me with the beating of her sleek wings and streamlined, slender body.  "You can’t go!  Stop!"

What I was hoping to accomplish then I do not know.  Naked, foodless, weak, and considerably disoriented, I surely would have sooner perished than reach my destination.  But I did not think this at the time.   When Jewdewfae landed on my shoulder, clinging on to my oak colored hair, I swatted her away as if she were a fly, a pest!  How cruel of me in retrospect, to reward my savior with mindless violence.  But she respected my behavior and let me slip free, though I could see that she was still watching and following me from a distance, taking the disguises of wildlife to mask herself.

The further I ran, however, the weaker I felt.  Older and wearier, aches returning to my joints that my young body had freed me from without my notice.  The weakness became worse and worse, my skin wrinkling with each step, the perkiness of my feminine curves sagging with the ravages of age.  My hair thinned and my heart beat irregularly until I collapsed, breathless, my life passing away.

This was when I felt strong arms heave me up over a brawny woodsman’s shoulders, tossing my fading husk against his neck to be carried back from where I had fled.  I struggled to remain conscious.  Though the form was unfamiliar to me, I knew the woodsman could only be Jewdewfae, rescuing me once again.  The closer he carried me my tree-body the more life and youth returned to me, revitalized by proximity to its leaves and bark.  At last he returned me to the tree itself and set me down back on my feet, his face sad and weary.  He needed not explain.  I was not truly free.  I could never truly go home, to venture from this sacred and cursed forest.  It was not my imagination that I could still faintly sense everything that the tree could.  I was still bound to it in spirit; our lives were still one even if our bodies were not.  Overcome by emotion in a way I have not since a young boy, I broke into tears.

Jewdewfae silently comforted me, embracing me from behind, wrapping his arms around me protectively as my tears trickled onto his arms.  He stroked my hair and massaged my quivering shoulders, his tender fingers warm and smooth and soft.  I embraced the warmth, the comfort, the presence of company and friendship.  When my eyes ran dry and had no more tears to shed,  I turned around and gazed deep into his sparkling blue eyes.

Once more I cannot explain why I acted as I did just then.  I kissed Jewdewfae, a long embrace, his lips warm against mine.  He returned my passion as eagerly as I provided it.  He lowered me to the ground on a soft bed of leaves.  There he lay with me for many hours, gifting me with the intense and wonderful new ecstasy of being made love to in the body of a young woman.  As the hours passed we made love unending, Jewdewfae shifting between man and woman based on the mood of the moment, both of which I found equally stimulating to my insatiable lust.

Hours passed into days, days into weeks, months of joyful playing and frolicking followed by nights of love.  I had no need of food nor water; my tree half provided us with all the sustenance needed from the sun, soil, and rain.  Jewdewfae showed me all the shapes she could take and slowly even I learned how I could reshape my skin and bones at will, to change myself into a deer or bird or fish as could my fae lover, to spawn with her in the creek or curl up together in a sparrow’s nest and sing our mating calls. 

I should not have been surprised when my belly began to swell and my breasts plump with mother''s milk.  Once again my life would change in ways I could never have imagined.

"So how long have you been a tree?  I bet ''yer real eager to get out and stretch ''yer legs a bit, arentcha?" The winged girl asked.  Of course I could not speak as I had no mouth.  Even if I did my mind was still straining to summon up some remembrance of spoken language.  "Well, let me see what I can do!" She giggled, flying rings about my trunk, searching for some feature or flaw of my bark-imprisoned body in which to free me from my curse.

Some hours passed this way, the winged girl poking at my fur, peeling away small strips of bark, sampling my roots and leaves, chewing on them thoughtfully as though my herbal essence might reveal to her some new bounty of insight.  As the evening crept into night she slept in a nest with a family of young chicks, changing into a bird and squawking alongside the others to be fed by the mother.  As hours turn into days I grew doubtful of her abilities and her interest by this time, I must confess.  But she persisted, taking shade underneath my canopy of leaves when the sun struck down from its highest and finding refuge in the nest of my hollow when night fell.

"My sisters really got you good," she sighed on the morning of the seventh day.  "I don''t know if I can crack their magic here, it''s pretty strong.  You musta'' eaten some food sprinkled with Dalila''s Ruin.  Nasty nasty plant, very rare.  Doesn''t grow on this side of the ocean at all.   I''m really running out of ideas here, Biggie.  Except for one but I don''t think ''yer gonna like it..."
 
The fae sat down on my sturdiest branch and began to chant some incantation in a language I did not recognize, an old and forgotten tongue, or perhaps one mankind has never been privileged to learn.  Yet as her song went on I could began to understand a word here and there, a phrase.. An expression, a raw emotion!  I could understand!  Her song was of the inferno of the sun, the tears of the sea, the fading of mountains by eons of wind and rain!  A song of the timeless monsters of the deep and the isolation of a sun-whitened skull stranded forgotten in a vast desert.  A song of the cycle of predator and prey, of hawks and hares, mice and owls, wolves and deer, the endless cycle of life and death and rebirth.  As the song became familiar to me II too could feel the words on my tongue and so I sang alongside the fae from the fathoms of my lonely heart.

I sang!  I had a voice again!  My voice, pure and sweet, blended with the lyrics of Jewdewfae.  How could this be?  I at long last had found some measure of freedom from my existence as a tree, yet my voice was not my own.  As this eeriness dawned on me I shrieked, at once shattering the spell of the song.  At once I felt my body suffocating of crampedness.  I felt constricted, crushed, wedged in a hollow far too small!  I needed to escape!

"Shhh, calm down ya Biggie!" Jewdewfae laughed at me.  In a blink she was a tiny winged girl no more but a full grown woman of human size and stature, seizing my shoulder and heaving me out of the wooden hollow which encased the majority of my body.  I was human once more, crawling out of my tree-body through a hollow like a newborn from the womb.  I would soon learn just how newborn I truly was as I fell to the ground, muscles weak as if I had never used them before.  I lay there, naked, face down in the dirt.  How strange to have a face again after so many years of possessing none, for my vision to be restricted to straight in front of me instead of from every direction at once as I could as a tree!  How strange to once more breath with relaxing and contracting lungs instead of the slow calm sip of air through my leaves!  How small and fragile I felt now, a fleshy biped scrabbling about in the dirt to feed his belly just to live another day!  A panic nearly overtook me, a desire to crawl back within my comforting prison and resume my peaceful slumber anchored firmly in the ground!

"''Yer not gonna just lay on the ground all day, are ya?" Jewdewfae teased.  I felt her arms wrap underneath my shoulders, lifting my weak body to my feet, turning me around to face her, my fae savior!  "Easy now!  So what''s ''yer name, Biggie?"

I fought to remember how to move my lips to reply.  "Matthias," I told the fae-woman.  But my voice was not any I had ever heard before, certainly not my own!  I gasped and threw my hands up to clutch at my throat, but my hands were stopped by a most unfamiliar protrusion--breasts!  Supple, soft, firm womanly breasts right on my my own chest!

Energized by my wonder and panic I rushed to the stream to catch a glimpse of my reflection in the trickling water.  I fell to my knees and gazed upon the form of a slender woman who moved as I did, her heavy, milky pale breasts heaving up and down with my own deep gasps!  I was her and she was me!  No longer was I Matthias the adventurer and explorer, nor even a man... who was I?  What had I become?

“What, you never seen a lady before?” Jewdewfae laughed, embracing me from behind as I crouched in the mud, still in the form of a full grown woman wearing a frayed blue dress.  Her touch calmed me; it had been many years since I''d known the touch of a woman, let alone a fellow being of flesh and blood!  Exhausted, I fell back into her arms and lay down with my head upon her lap.  I gazed down my new form past my breasts to my hips, legs, and feet.  A woman I was; a gentle touch between my legs confirmed that not a trace of manhood remained upon my body, replaced instead with the folds of a woman.

Jewdewfae sang me a lullaby as I lost consciousness and drifted into sleep.  The follow morning I would learn of my fate.

<i>Editor’s note:  Several pages are lost from the narrative here.  While Sunnyglade scholars and historians have some competing theories as of the events that transpired in this period of time, readers should assume nothing beyond what Mabel herself wrote.  The narrative continues below.</i>

<b>Date and year unknown</b>.  What can I write?  Who could possibly believe me should anyone ever read this journal again?  The pages are soaked; the ink has blotted together, obscuring my thoughts as I had written so many months back.  Even my memory is as indistinct as the splashes of darkness that seep through the paper like a wound that soaks through all its bandages…  What little I have been able to save has only been through the greatest help of the young fairy, my tiny little savior… 

I shall recount the events of the past few years--decades perhaps?--the best I can.  Late in spring--May, as the Fae has helped me to revive from the soggy remnants of my journal--was when I joined with nature, with the rocks and trees around me, my roots sipping at the steady trickle of the lake through the years.  The magic of the original inhabitants of the forest--dangerous and mischievous fairies as I would later learn, tricking me with the feast they had laid out for me--had changed my body into that of a young tree fighting to grow tall and steal as great a share of the sun as possible underneath the canopy of elder trees and branches.

How could any human soul understand that which I felt and endured?  As the magic of the forest’s inhabitants passed through my body from that tainted dinner, my skin had changed to bark, my arms raised, locked in place, reaching up to grasp at the light of the sun.  How could any mortal comprehend the sweetness of sap as it slowly flows through one’s veins, giving life to the leaves at the extremities of a multitude of arms, then feeling the pinch and crinkle as autumn steals them away, the weight of snow and ice crushing down the skeleton branches all winter long?  The tickle of tiny birds’ feet scratching along the skin, the ceaseless chatter and warmth of a family of squirrels nesting in a snug little hollow?  How to describe the ecstatic shiver as bees circle around and sip at one’s blossoms in springtime?  The long groan of a squelching summer drought and the relief of a heavy rain, the crash of thunder and lightning striking at you and your neighbors yet immobilized and powerless to evade it?  The swaying of our arms as great winds threaten to tear you apart and topple you?  The itching left from the wounds as bucks grind their antlers against your trunk, the humiliation of a wild alpha wolf marking you as his territorial boundary?  All this I saw and felt and more, unable to move or speak, watching as the rains soaked through the leather binding of my journal and wash out the last reminder of my former humanity.

How then did my old life not rot away with the muddy pages of my journal, to become nothing more and nothing less than another tree in a great untamed forest?  It was through no volition of my own.  I had long resigned myself to the earth when the fairy came to me.  I can recall the morning when she found me better as a lone incident than any others over the span of the years.  I was standing still, as only a tree can, when a young winged woman just nine inches tall fluttered to me and landed on the branch that had long ago been my left arm.  At first I took no special notice or care, mistaking her for a bluebird stopping by as thousands had done in mornings past.  But then she spoke.  I had not heard uttered language in such a long time!  My attention perked and I wondered if I had been dreaming.

“You feel funny,” she said, squirming against a smooth patch of the branch where the bark had fallen away..  “You some kinda funny tree or somethin’?”

I trembled, a faint vibration mimicking the disturbance of a gentle breeze--all the movement I could muster, and even this simple gesture drained me of much strength and willpower.

“You ARE funny!” she giggled, jumping to her tiny, mudcaked feet.  “You’re not a tree at all, are you?  What are you, a nymph?  A shy little goddess?  A really bad witch?”  With this she lifted herself up into the air with her translucent blue wings, zipping around my trunk like a fly seeking honey.  As she circled by me I caught glimpses of pale blue tattoos across her arms and face, a tattered sky blue dress scarcely clinging to her petite womanly body.  She traced a tiny finger around my skin and through my leaves, her touch warm in a way I had not felt in eons… the warmth of flesh against my own!

“No, you’re not any of those, are ya?  You’re not playing a prank on me, are you, sis Dela-Dru-Onomoaon?  Nah, couldn’t be…”  She came to rest, clinging on to the bump that once had been my nose like a moth.  “You’re… I know!  I know!  You’re a Biggie!  You’re a silly dumb cute human!  Oh boy… my sisters got to you, didn’t they?  They don’t much like it when you 
biggies tromp through these woods.  I probably shouldn’t be talking with you at all right now.  But this forest is just so… so… boring!  Tell you what, let’s make a deal.  If I free you, do promise to play with me for like, forever?  My name’s Jewdewfae.  I’d shake your hand, but, you know…  You’re a tree!  And you don’t have any hands!  Because you’re a tree!”

My heart--metaphorically of course, as whatever human organs I possessed before must not have been present in my current state--leapt.  Could she do such a thing?  Restore me back into a man?  And if she could, had I already lost too much of my humanity to survive it?  Or had it been too long, my fate sealed as a silently wooden inhabitant of these strange and uncharted lands?

INSERT [dbo].[Tomes] ([Id], [Text], [BaseItem_Id]) VALUES (9, N'<span class=''booktitle''>An Exploration of Fae Volume 2:  the Elders Clan</span><br><br>

<span class=''bookauthor''>By Nigel Pricklegrape</span><br><br>

The Elders are a much older family than the Winston clan and differ greatly in their interactions, philosophies, and sources of magicks.  Far less is known on the origin of the Elders.  What I can confidently say is that the oldest among them is well over a hundred a fifty thousand years old whereas Jewdewfae, one of the youngest of her clan, is approximately a hundred and two thousand years of age, give or take a few centuries.  The Elders take little notice of the lessor passings of time and are sometimes surprised to discover that a tiny sapling they planted had already grown to be a millennia old before ultimately succumbing to fire or drought, falling down and rotting away to permit a new generation of trees to reach toward the sun.

Unlike the Winstons, the Elders have no one home, no grove to which they are bound, no flower from which they are born and reborn.  Although their origins can be traced back to Ireland where they were birthed into existence from the strange and ancient ley lines that converge near ancient stone monuments, the Elders are naturally nomadic.  These restless fae spend no more than a few years in a nest before moving on to find new home, whether their destination lies a mile away or a thousand.  I do not know the precise reason for this, but I speculate that the Elders draw magic from the nature surrounding them, from the water, trees, rocks, sun, air, even the beasts that walk on four legs on the ground or sail through the air on wings.  Staying in any one location for too long risks exhausting the ambient magical energies that make their living possible, or so I am led to deduce.

As with the Winston clan, the Elders view themselves as caretakers of the natural world and all its fauna and flora, killing not so much as an ant in the span of a (very long) lifetime.  The Elders are as such true pacifists (though to say so is misleading, since while the Elders may never shed a drop of blood against the living, they have no such qualms about transforming intruders into trees and statues until the end of time, as I shall have more to say about later!)

The Elders present themselves as young women, typically about nine inches tall with translucent wings and glowing faintly with pale blue runic tattoos.  It is not technically correct to say that the Elders are female.  As with the Winstons, the Elders do not produce offspring with their own kind.  However, since every Elder is a born shapeshifter, it is possible for an Elder to adopt a male form and pass on their genes to a compatible non-fae, though this has only happened several times in the Elder''s long history to my knowledge, and I cannot imagine the sisters took kindly to this!

When it comes to governance, there is essentially no social structure amongst the Elders, no distinction between greater fairy or lessor, no mother-daughter lineages or central matriarch to guide the clan.  Each fae is her own being of equal power and rank, addressing one another respectfully by "sister".  The Elder clan is run loosely as a democracy--or perhaps, dare I say, an anarchy!  How can they organize their migrations to a new nest, you might ask!  As strange as it may seem to us humans, the Elder fae have little problem with such.  When a majority of the clan decides a new nesting ground is in order, the rest of the family typically agree and move as one.  No fae holds claim to any property or personal belongings for long, though minor petty squabbling is common as any sisters are bound to do.

While there have been some short-lived peaceful schisms when the clan separated into multiple smaller nests--not to mention a few hermits who thought it might be restful to take a long nap as an oak tree or hill for a few hundred to thousand years--the Elders have always come back together again.  In the occasion that an Elder misbehaves or offends a fellow sister, the others use social ostracism instead of violence, shunning the wrongdoer for some years until the issue is addressed with a proper apology or the act forgotten and forgiven as a meaningless transgressions from the past.

It should not surprise my readers that the Elders have never taken a likening to humanity, despising our destructive tendencies to force the land to adapt to us instead of living in harmony with it.  At first humans were a rarity and could be safely ignored, just another somewhat intelligent species to keep an eye on and wait for either our extinction or migration away. .  However, humankind began to not only survive but proceeded to thrive, reaching all ends of the earth and felling entire forests to farms, blasting mountains and draining lakes.  It finally became clear to the Elders that humanity posed some threat to their way of life. For hundreds of our generations any Elder who spotted a human would immediately transform them into a tree, stone, flower, rabbit, deer, or some other suitable form of wildlife.  Else they might embed their victim''s spirit with that of a local natural landmark, binding their soul to the land for an eternity. Who amongst you have not heard of some tale of a Lady of the Lake, Weeping Willow, or Will-o-the-Wisp, heard the whispering of pines in a gentle breeze?

However, no matter how many humans they transformed and wove back into nature, humans kept on breeding children who followed in their ancestors'' footsteps in greater and greater number.  Our urge to explore and adventure kept generation after generation of explorers and settlers penetrating deeper into the Elders'' lands, quickly forgetting those lost to the fae''s retaliation.  Finally realizing that their efforts would ultimately be in vain, the Elders adopted a new policy to simply hide as best they could, casting spells only on those who wandered too close to their current nesting grounds by curiosity or chance.  As farms sprung into villages, villages to towns, and towns to cities, the Elders kept retreating into isolation, eventually leaving their rainy island home to seek solace on the great lands to the west.  There they found the peace they craved for some time thousand years.  But of course not even that was to last.

Stories are all well and good, but what if you should chance to meet an Elder yourself?  If you ever see an Elder fae, I regret to inform you that you likely do not have long to run and hide.

While most Elders would rather hide out of sight until clumsy humans have finished passing by some of the crueler Elders have found some measure of vengeance and have become devious tricksters, shattering their own policies of isolation and nonintervention to cast spells upon some unsuspecting victims.  In one notorious legend, three fae came upon a village and changed each and every inhabitant into marble statues.  A year later visitors came by to trade only to find dozens of petrified men and women frozen in shocked (and some oddly lustfully ecstatic!) stances and expressions.  There are many variations on this in which instead of statues visitors find a pack of deer still wearing their peasant garb, or instead of deer bleating sheep or whinnying ponies.  Some may be dismissed as legend, but I would not discount these stories possessing strange truths.

Should you stumble across a ring of naked stone women locked dancing or making love in a remote corner of the woods, count your blessings and hope the Elders have already moved on, and perhaps whisper some kind words into the poor souls'' ears.  Should you see a tree with the strange contours of a man or woman, chances are not slim that they used to walk the earth on two legs as you or I do.  And if you fall victim yourself, be aware that the Elders have little interest in ever restoring you to your form self again.

If I have provided a frightening vision of the Elders, know I do so only for your own safety!  But not all that can be said of this ancient and noble clan is for the ill!

While the Elders do harbor bitterness toward humankind, it is not entirely unheard of to see some of the younger Elders fae make peaceful contact with "the Biggies."  Most often these adventurous fae youths venture into Sunnyglade or nearby towns to cause mischief, using their magic to prank innocent passers-by for no reason other than some laughs.  Most often these pranks are harmless enough, swapping minds of genders of lovers in the middle of their passions, shrinking a pedestrian down to an inch or two tall, blowing you up like a balloon and making you cling on to a friend or tree before you float up into the sky!  These transformation usually last for no longer than a day or week at most.

If you put on a good show and provide your watchers enough giggles, you may find yourself visited again and again with all new manners of mischief, so if you wish to avoid future encounters your best chance is to pretend nothing is wrong and keep your calm.  Bore your bullies away.  With their desire for fun and chaos fulfilled, or some other poor Biggie providing a more entertaining subject to harass with their magic, you ought to resume life with only a few embarrassing stories, something you and the pals to laugh about over drinks in a year or two.  I''ve even spoken to a chap or two who say they''ve rather come to enjoy these little surprises… perhaps even addicted to their magic, which is often said to fill its target with great ecstasy  and arousal as their bodies change.

Yet even among these few playful fae, only one has ever truly befriended humans, the youth named Jewdewfae.  She boasts of having been the first of her clan to meet a Biggie.  Oh, of the countless hours I have spent with her, exchanging games and my own intimacy to bargain for a coherent story of her elusive clan!  She bores easily and forgets her commitments, teasing me for spending so many years of my life with a pen in my hand!  She tells me that in the past hundred years she has spent far more time amongst mankind than her own sisters, leading her to be perpetually ostracized by even the most open-minded of her sisters.  And though she is as mischievous as any other youths,  Jewdewfae is also unique in that she, with her kind heart, do all she can to restore the less fortunate victims of her sisters back to their human form, or failing that, the closest humanoid approximations.  The more literary minded among you may recall that Jewdewfae has a hand in terms founding Sunnyglade itself.

And such concludes what little I can share of the clan known as the Elders.', 319)

<span class=''bookauthor''>By Nigel Pricklegrape</span>

If you are a loyal reader of mine, you are already aware of my love for exotic races. From kitsune to nagas, I like to leave no stone unturned. However, there is one race in particular that I have been dying to explore but have never gotten the opportunity to do so and that is the elusive fae. The fae have always been very secluded and rarely do they interact with any non-fae (and those poor souls that do get to interact with fae often end up as trees or the like). I have tried for learn more with very little luck. The most I learned was from a fae called Rachael Winston who was kind enough to tell me a little bit about herself, but it was by far not enough to write a biography. That is, until I ran into a fairy called Violet Winston. Much like Rachael, she is a great fairy of the Winston grove which until now was shrouded in mystery. Violet told me that their fairy council had decided that it was time the people of Sunnyglade learned of its location and she came to me personally to give me the honours of being the first one! That is not the only fae she talked to me about though as she was also vastly knowledgeable about a different sisterhood of fae. A much more ancient clan of fae that she refers to as ''The Elders''. One such fairy is one most of us are probably already familiar with, namely Jewdewfae. Violet was able to tell me a lot about the dark secrets that lie within this elder sisterhood and how different it is in comparison to her own sisterhood. It was a very interesting talk, and I shall talk in detail about both kinds of fae, beginning with the Winston grove.

Violet thought that it was best if I saw it all with my own eyes, and thus I was transformed into a fairy myself (It felt pretty strange, being so small, not to mention being made female (for there are no male fairies) but then again, I believe we have all gone through that at some point) and I was led into the grove. The sights were simply smashing! There were fairies everywhere, the place was absolutely littered with flowers of all shapes, colours and sizes and the central tree was simply stunning. It was a lot to take in, but I had little time to react as a lot of the fae flying around all came darting at me the moment they saw me, all wanting to greet me and happily ask who I was. I assumed that they had all expected my arrival but considering I was female now, I decided to introduce myself as Nicole.

After that initial greeting, Violet was finally able to fly me around the grove. We flew in a circle around the central tree and the sights were simply astonishing, but I shall not dwell on it for too long as by the time you are reading this, you will probably already be on your way to see it for yourself! Eventually we arrived at quite a massive flower that was perched on one of the branches of the central tree. Now this flower was unlike any flower that I had ever seen as this one opened up at Violet''s touch and it revealed itself to actually be a house of sorts. That is when I realized that all of the flowers I had seen up until that point must have all also been homes to the fairies! How fascinating.

At this point I was of course overflowing with questions as I was led inside Violet''s home, but she simply held up her hand with a laugh. She was going to explain everything one thing at a time. Good thing too because I don''t think she would have survived my onslaught of questions! First she explained to me how the Winston grove came to be in the first place. It has been standing now for well over 9000 years and the central tree was first planted by nature itself. In its first few years, it simply grew but after a good 200 years, the first flowers started to grow. Flowers that would soon reveal themselves to house new young fairies. Violet, as well as the earlier mentioned Rachael were one of those first fae. As Violet was able to tell me though, Rachael was apparently known as Valencia back then, but she had died roughly 143 years ago. Naturally this piqued my curiosity. If Rachael had died once, why was she still around now? That is how I learned that fairies, with the help of great fairies, reincarnate. When a fae is born she is born from a flower, as I already explained before, and the fae will always keep a special connection with this flower. It becomes their house, their source of magic and even something much more than that. When a fairy dies, her flower will wither. This represents the passing of the old life. In its place, a great fae will grow a new flower, together with the spirit of the deceased fae and she is reborn again, but with no recollection of her previous life. This rarely happens though as fae can live eternally and they are very hard to kill (but why anyone would want to do so is beyond me). Naturally I got curious again now. What would happen if the flower is destroyed while the fae is still out and about all full of life? Violet told me that when this happens, said fairy would lose her ability to use magic (at least, until the flower is restored again). Quite a sad thing to happen in both cases, but interesting to learn about nonetheless!

Now, I was curious about something else. When I met Rachael, she had three young fae with her that referred to her as ''mom'' rather than sister. I had also see that most of the flowers in the grove were not all on the central tree, but around it instead. I asked how this all happened as I had assumed that all fae were sisters and were born from the tree. This is where I learned that the fairies of the Winston grove sometimes take in a non-fae as their child. This can happen in two ways. One: the fae grow a new flower in the grove and then imbue this flower with the spirit of the non-fairy. Over the next month, the new fairy will grow inside the flower and the spirit will completely be accustomed to its new lifestyle. All of this with the help of a great fairy. At this point they will still remember their past life, but none of these newer fae have shown any signs of regret and most even completely forget about their old lives after a while. Two: a great fairy can decide to have children of her own. Now this stumped me. One of the few things I knew about fae is that they cannot reproduce. At least, not the normal way. They can of course have sex, but solely for pleasure. Violet then explained to me how it was still possible to have children. First, the fairy turns herself into an alraune. It turns out that not only do alraune look and smell pretty, they can in fact also act as a birthing flower to a fae! Next up, the alraune fairy unbirths the soon to be daughter fairy and much like with method one, it takes about a month before she pops out again. Again, a great fairy must help out the pregnant alraune in order to help shape the new daughter fairy. These daughter fae are usually bigger and better at magic than their tree-kin, yet they are not considered great fae.

Now I was curious about this distinction between fae and great fae. Other than their size and what I already heard, I did not fully understand what a great fairy implies. Naturally, Violet explained! Great fae, in short, are seen as leaders. They help out the younger, lesser fae, they make the big decisions where needed and they simply possess much more magic than the lesser fae. A fairy is granted the status of great fairy by the high council usually after having achieved a great feat of some kind. This can be a journey of some kind or just a general showcase of great leadership.

''High council?'' I asked her. Yes, the great fae in the grove (currently there are 10 of them) have formed a council in order to keep more organized. Of these 10 great fae only one of them is not in the council. That being Rachael for she did not want to sit in a dusty meeting hall all day. Understandable! As such though, while she is still a great fairy and does do whatever the other great fae do, she is seen as much less of a leader.

Magic was the next subject that we explored. I had noticed previously that all of the fae that were flying around through the grove all seemed to be emitting light in all the colours that you could imagine. She explained to me that this was their magical core that resides within each and every one of them and it actually shines outwards. It also seemed that this core and this glow are directly tied to a fairy''s emotions. Positive emotions make them glow brighter while negative emotions make them glow dimmer. A very enlightening discovery if you excuse my pun! ''But wait Nigel, did you not say earlier that their flowers are the source of their magic?'' I hear you ask. Why yes, that is indeed what I said. Their magical cores is what''s directly tied to their flowers, hence why if a fae''s flower is destroyed, so is the link with her core. She may then only have enough magic for just a little bit before it is fully extinguished. It was now that I understood why the grove was kept secret for so long. They wouldn''t want any trespassers accidentally (or even purposefully) to step on their flowers! I was quite curious on whether I was even allowed to write this, but Violet seemed to be perfectly fine with it, telling me that they had recently charmed the flowers to be more defensive. Smashing!

At this point I got really curious about what distinguishes this grove from the ''Elders''. Well one of the biggest differences is that because the Winston grove is only 9000 years old, the fae have grown up in a world where humans have always been around. They have learned to grow up with them, how to deal with them and even grew to like them. As mentioned earlier, they sometimes even take in a human as one of their own. Still, they also realize how dangerous humans and the like can be, which is also a reason for why the grove is so heavily protected with a lot of charms. Most do not even know of its existence and a simple diversion charm solves a lot of problems alone. It is a funny little charm that makes people who do not know about the grove absentmindedly decide to just go elsewhere. But then what about harmful people who do know of its existence and wish to infiltrate? That can also be stopped easily. Every fairy has a certain mark somewhere on her body and this mark ensures entrance into the grove. When someone enters the grove that does not possess this mark, they will soon find themselves transforming into a small flower or the like to prevent them from going any further. The fae of the grove will then alter the infiltrator''s memories before they are let go again outside of the forest. They certainly are forgiving! I did now get quite worried about myself. I entered the grove without a mark after all. Violet reassured me that she kept that from happening with her own magic. I was quite relieved to hear that!

So by now, Violet told me that that was pretty much the most interesting facts about the Winston fairy grove that she was able to tell me. Now… it was time to finally talk about these ''Elders''!', 318)

<b>Day 1</b>
 <p>Dear diary, hello! I know that you are nothing, but a cheap collection of papers, but I hope that if I don''t make it, you will tell my story to the world. And if I DO make it, that my future publicist is reading this right now as part of a massive book deal I am being offered. Either way, thank you for taking the time to read my story.</p>
 <p>As of time of writing, it''s been a few days since everything went to hell, I don''t know if it was the magic that set it all in motion or if that just exacerbated things. Either way, the town is in shambles and just about the only people still left here are the crazy magical SOBs that keep blasting survivors into, well mostly women''s clothing. If this is the end of days, then just about every religious book that I have ever read was WAY off!</p>
 <p>Anyway, thinking about it, there is very little I really want to talk about right now diary, so I will leave you here for tonight.</p>

<b>Day 2</b>
 <p>The sneaky psychopathic bitch! Diary, it is only through luck and my own amazing skill that I am able to recount what happened to me today, and that was because today was very nearly the last day of my life as a human being!</p>
 <p>I had been walking back from, borrowing supplies from the Old Oak Apartments when I saw a young woman in the street, clearly in some distress. As I came closer, I saw she was holding what looked like a dog''s collar in one hand and was frantically searching for something. Obviously now I realize what a bad idea what I did next was, but at the time, I thought she was just a poor lost soul in need of help.</p>
 <p>I approached her, tried to offer her help, but when she turned around and saw me, it was like she was both looking at me and looking straight through me at the same time. She started ranting about her dog and started beckoning to me and ordering me to come back to momma. It took me a second to realize she was also casting a spell on me, but when I felt a tail starting to push against my pants I nearly jumped out of my skin! Luckily, it seems my magic was stronger than hers and even with her surprise attack; it was hardly a fair fight as I transformed her into a rather frilly bra.</p>
 <p>I considered taking her with me, these crazies lack the mental discipline to free themselves once transformed, but was far too unnerved by the idea of having a sentient item staring at me while I slept. Still, the rush of power I felt when she finally was locked into her new form was, exhilarating, I can''t help, but wonder how it would feel to do it again,</p>

<b>Day 3</b>
 <p>Diary, as I am sure you remember, yesterday I was attacked by one of this town''s plethora of crazed magical nut cases. That experience was frightening, but it also made me curious about these poor people driven mad by the very magical gift that has set them above normal people. This curiosity has led me to observe them and relay my findings to you.</p>
 <p>First of all, as I suspected from my own encounter with them, they are anti-social to an extreme. Even the slightest hint of aggression toward them, from a straight out attack to simply catching their eye seems to set them off and once angered, they will chase there aggravator all the way across the town till they have either vented their rage or been forcibly dealt with. While some more stable minded people I have observed have avoided this by keeping their eyes down at all times, when two Psychopaths cross paths when not otherwise distracted, a fight is inevitable, and since neither will back down, it is inevitably a fight to the, well not death, but close enough.</p>
 <p>Finally while their magical abilities are often impressive, their deranged mental states seem to leave them with only enough presence of mind to cast a single spell, over and over without deviation or thought to tactics. Interestingly, this limitation seems to be part of their affliction as even after finishing a fight, they will simply continue with the same spell on their next target, I do not know if this is due to some obsessive compulsive quirk, a limit to their abilities brought on by the damage to their minds or if they simply do not even realize that there various targets are different people.</p>
 <p>Whatever the reason, they are clearly too far gone to be helped and far too dangerous to treat as anything less than wild animals.</p>

<b>Day 4</b>
 <p>Diary I write in you today more shaken than I have ever been in my whole life! I don''t know if there is something wrong with me or if the time I have spent in this town is just hardening me to common decency. Whatever the reason, I think I might have crossed a line I might not be able to come back from.</p>
 <p>You see, I was out making observations on the town''s inhabitants and collecting what supplies I could when I saw a man approaching me from down the street. Knowing what an encounter with another person in this town often means, I lashed out, striking at them with the same frilly bra spell which worked so well before. They responded and before long we were caught in an all-out battle, which might explain why I did not notice at the time that he was trying different tactics, utilizing things he carried on his person and even seemed to react with appropriate fear when I began to take the upper hand.</p>
 <p>But while I can forgive myself for ignoring that, I cannot just forget what happened next,</p>
 <p>I was close to finishing him, when he turned and fled, doing something that no psychopath I have ever observed ever do! And, flushed with adrenalin and blinded by my own desire, no NEED to win I ran him down like a dog. By the time he collapsed from exhaustion in the ballroom of the long abandoned mansion, I was too far gone to stop myself from finishing the spell, even as he feebly begged for me to spare him.</p>
 <p>It was almost a full minute afterwards that I realized what I had done and dropped my prize on the dusty floor, fleeing the scene of my heinous crime.</p>

<b>Day 6</b>
 <p>Dear diary, I have spent the last two days in hiding, trying to understand what drove me to do what I did to that other mage. In that time I mulled over the events of the fight, the other spell casters methods and my own motivations and it has all led me to one inevitable conclusion.</p>
 <p>If he had been stronger, he would still be here.</p>
 <p>All of us still here in Sunnyglade are blessed with magical powers beyond mortal understanding and yet so many of them squander this gift! They run around like insects, picking through the trash, looking for things to help them stave off their inevitable fall to the stronger magic users. And like insects, when they cross paths with their betters, they are crushed.</p>
 <p>My defeating that man was no more wrong than if I had slapped a mosquito whose bite had annoyed me. I have let my misplace guilt slow me down, but tomorrow I hit the streets and hone my skills, till I no longer need to fear being crushed under the feet of someone more powerful than myself.</p>

<b>Day 8</b>
 <p>HELP ME! IF ANYONE FINDS THIS, A LOATHFUL PSYCHOPATH IS TRYING TO TURN ME INTO A BR</p>

 <p>Dear diary, I am sorry that you have been spoiled by my RUDE pray. You will be happy to know that even though they scribbled baseless slander all over you in pen that they will never have a chance to do that again to anyone else''s private property.</p>
 <p>Honestly, I used to think that the psychopaths of this town were the real problem, but since I have started to patrol the streets, improving my skills and cleaning this town of the filth that infests it, I have learned that the so called ''sane'' towns people are just as bad! While some show their respect by averting their eyes as they pass me, others flagrantly show there disrespect and then have the gall to run when I try to punish them for their insolence!</p>
 <p>It hardly matters though, none of them can escape me and none of them can challenge me.</p>
 <p>As for you, dear diary, I think our time together is coming to an end. You have done your job of chronicling my rise and revelations admirably and now it is time for you to share what I have learned with the world. I will leave you with the proprietor of Words of Wisdom and they will see that you are read by anyone with enough sense to recognize the value of my wisdom.</p>

<span class=''bookauthor''>A notice from Ambassador Delaar of the High Council of the Eastern Five Realms</span>

Inhabitants of Sunnyglade, let it be known that we have reason to believe you may soon or already have encountered two legendary members of the infamous Seekshadow Guild, a pair of thieves in the form of humanoid rats known as Brother Lujako and Sister Lujinne Seekshadow.  While the motives these thieves have in traveling to your realm and disrupting the peace in your city are unknown to us, we wish to list our grievances with this dangerous duo and notify your denizens that the High Council of the Eastern Five Realms have offered a bounty to anyone who is able to bring these rampant criminals to justice.

In order to better understand the nature of these Seekshadow thieves, here is a brief recounting of some of their most famous criminal undertakings.

<h3>
 The Theft of Sun Staff of Delgoromakadedt
</h3>

An ancient symbol of a great family, the Sun Staff of Delgoromakadedt was stolen from the royal palace''s vaults on a warm summer day during the routine afternoon change of the guard.  The thieves evidently scaled the walls using both conventional hooks and chains as well as some unknown cloaking magic to conceal their ascent from onlookers. Their plan had not gone flawlessly, however, and once at the top of the wall several guards discovered the intruders and attempted to stop them.  The thieves'' superior martial prowess overwhelmed the patrol and they passed through the front gates to find and loot the target of their mission.

Precise details of this encounter are vague as none of the guards who participated in the melee are willing to speak of the incident and offer a narrative of events.  Lujienne seems to have cast some dreadful curse of silence upon all of the soldiers there to witness the battle.  Anyone afflicted by the curse would begin to transform into bronze statues in the shape of voluptuous dancing women, the curse triggered by each word of the encounter that victim uttered to investigators, friends, or family alike.  Naturally, few desired to reveal any information and suffer these effects.  We only have the record that we do about this encounter from the bravery of the patrol''s captain who, out of an impressive and noble (not to mention quite overzealous) loyalty to his king and queen, quickly retold as much of the short battle as he could before the bronze sealed over his lips, replacing the last few remnants of his skin with polished bronze.

The captain, now a beautiful bronze woman locked in the pose of a dancer, was later mounted on a pedestal in the royal gardens where she remains to this day.  New recruits and devoted soldiers have begun to make regular pilgrimages to honor her sacrifice and take an oath to take vengeance on the Seekshadow thieves, should they attempt to return.  But it''s also said some only come to admire her silent standing beauty or rub her nipples for good luck.  It is said you can faintly hear her squeak in delight to those who do, giving some hope that one day she may be restored and pursue the thieves even years after the crime.

<h3>
2.  The Abduction of Baron Gastlalia''s Daughter
</h3>

Baron Gastlalia, a wealthy and rather unpopular landlord in the islands of the Gathonian archipelago, rushed up to his young twenty year old daughter''s bedroom after hearing suspicious scraping sounds upstairs.  When he entered the chamber he saw the bed empty, sheets drawn back and crumpled on the floor.  The window was wide open despite an arcane seal of protection that had nonetheless been shattered by the thieves'' invasive magic.

On the daughter''s bed was a note that demanded the sum of a great amount of Arpeyjis for her safe return, followed by a warning not to attempt and pursue the thieves through the surrounding woods.  Not heeding the warning and unwilling to suffer the indignity of paying the ransom, the baron drafted a search party from some mercenaries, hunters, and coerced peasants, departing a day later.  The trackers quickly stumbled upon a trail of clues indicating which route the thieves had taken and where they had set up camp at night.  Too easy to find, some wisely warned, as if they were intentionally baiting the baron to follow.

The thieves'' threats were indeed not idle, and one by one nearly all of the members of the search party stumbled across cursed runes and charms concealed by the wilderness.  The unfortunate man or woman who triggered the trap was quickly transformed into various forest wildlife such as deer, squirrels, hawks, rabbits, bluejays, otters, bears, a male and female raccoon, foxes, wolves, and four legged or winged beasts of many other varieties.  Each transformed victim retained his or her memories of their human selves for several days following their transformation, tagging along with the party so as to not be mistaken as wild game to be shot for meat.  But in time all eventually wandered off and were never seen again, lured away by the temptation of finding mates amongst the wilderness.

The baron himself was the thieves'' last victim before the hunt was called off, tripping over a seal that transformed him into a great fat mindless boar.  Some say that his fearful and furious remaining search party members had led him deliberately into it as a way to seek retribution for their conscription, not to mention the loss of friends, husbands, wives, sons, and daughters.  The whereabouts of the baron''s daughter remains a mystery to this day, but there are rumors that she rejected an offer to be freed and joined up with the Seekshadows, possibly having even orchestrated the abduction from the very beginning.  As for the baron, a financial trust was set up to safeguard his assets.  It''s members do their best to interpret the boar''s every grunt, trying to detect some type of signal or communication as to who will inherit the baron''s dwindling wealth.   But anyone who has seen what remains of the baron firsthand sees nothing more than a particularly obese and pampered hog.

<h3>
3.  The Theft at the Brothel of the Seven Singing Stones
</h3>

High on the greatest level of the Great Ziggurat atop Mount Whistlesong is an abandoned brothel built over an old temple known as the Brothel of the Seven Singing Stones.  Otherwise unextraordinary, the high priest who oversaw the temple successfully salvaged seven singing stones from an ancient wrecked vessel sunk to the bottom of a nearby ocean trench.  Although their mystical properties were unknown at first and thought of nothing more than pretty ornaments, by accident several of the priests later found that they had unique arcane powers when arranged in a star formation.  These crystal orbs possessed magic which would enhance the beauty and restore the youth of anyone who stood within the star, sometimes changing the priests into priestesses or the other way around, the being transforming into whatever form they secretly felt was the most beautiful in existence.  The transformation would last weeks at a time depending on how long the person inside was exposed.  However, the experimenting priests eventually learned that staying within that influence too long at a time would cause the occupants to lose their minds and memories to their bliss and rationed out who could enjoy the power of the singing stones powers carefully and jealously.

It didn''t take long for the high priest to monetize this opportunity, selecting himself a few of his favorite priests to become as beautiful and unimaginably seductive gods and goddesses fit to satisfy the pickiest of kings and queens for years at a time.  Some transformed priests and priestesses traveled away, renting him or herself as courtesans to their client or even be married into royalty directly.  Those who stayed converted the temple to a brothel, drawing in clients from all of the Allied Realms who would spend great sums of money to enjoy the sexual companionship of the concubine priests and priestesses.  Others, at great price, purchased the privilege to stay a few minutes within the star themselves and bathe in its erotic warmth.

After thirteen years of this unquestionably profitable operation, Lujienne and Lujako infiltrated the temple disguised as wealthy patrons.  Smuggling in knives and summoning spears from thin air, they herded all of the bewildered priests, priestesses, and miscellaneous visitors within the ring.  Crowded together and becoming stupefied by the inrush of erotic bliss their victims too little to no notice as the thieves robbed the treasury and the silk garments worn by the crowd.  The duo held the unfortunate mob in place for all fifteen hours of the night, several times longer than anyone had dared spend between the singing stones than ever before. 

At dawn the duo finally stole the priceless singing stones themselves and escaped completed unopposed, the overexposed and sexually overwhelmed captives far too lost in an endless naked orgy realize what was happening outside of their immediate carnal pleasures.  Investigation became a dangerous ordeal, the grouping of so much otherworldly beauty such an alluring sight to behind that they posed great danger to any man or woman who laid eyes upon them, tempting them to join the throng of moans and gasps of pleasure.  The entire ziggurat was soon abandoned, the remaining priests lucky enough to have been away with clients taking what wealth remained and leaving their companions to their fate of the torment of infinite mindless pleasure.  While travel to the mountain is now forbidden, on certain nights the wind still carries the sounds of lovemaking down from the peak of the ziggurat and a few souls go missing every year when they are lured up through loneliness or curiosity.

<h3>
4.  The Dismantling of the Village of Eldertide
</h3>

One might be tempted to think of this duo as romantic heroes stealing from those who don''t deserve their wealth, but by no means do the Seekshadow thieves redistribute to the poor as does your realm''s iconic bandit--a certain Robin Hood, we believe you call him.  Common folks have also been the target of the Seekshadow thieves'' greed and simple pettiness, and few of their crimes demonstrate this better than the dismantling of the village of Eldertide.

The Seekshadow guild expands its territory and influence as any growing population does.  In this instance the guild master had her eyes and ears set on the sleepy small village of Eldertide, a colony well hidden amongst caves and rocks, so impoverished that over the centuries few kings or queens even remembered its existence, the tax collectors not even bothering to waste the time traveling there.  This led to a degree of independence from various monarchs and later on the principalities and republics who technically ruled over them on paper.  When Seekshadow agents approached, demanding the village clear out some houses to make room for a new guild hall and dock, the townsfolk refused and chased the representatives out with farming and fishing instruments, the only weapons they peaceful villagers had on hand.

Lujienne and Lujako was the guild''s response.  One evening the two approached disguised as weary humble travelers and were welcomed in for what food the host family could spare as well as a warm bed for a night or two.  The first family was that of Patrick Fenshaw and his wife Lula Gardens.  In the middle of the night as the couple slept, Lujienne cast an enchantment on Patrick that gave him the body and memories of their neighbor''s soon-to-be-wed virgin daughter and changed Lula into a doppleganger of the village''s elderly baker.  Dazed, the two sleptwalk (assisted by magic no doubt) to the hovels each respectively now believed to be their home, crawling into bed alongside the original inhabitants.  Dawn was broken by two loud shrieks coming from the neighbor''s house, two loud womanly screeches as Patrick and the daughter woke up next to each other, identical for all appearances.

Before long the townspeople had all woken and gathered about the two panicked girls, as confused as one might expect.  It took until late afternoon before the townsfolk realized that the elderly baker could be seen walking about the crowd at different places at the same time, the poor man and his doppleganger''s discovery setting off another bout of commotion  Having made no progress deciding which of the clones were the originals and which the duplicates, not to mention having neglected their jobs for the entire day, the villagers went to sleep, never noticing that Patrick and Lula''s house had been completely dismantled and its materials removed by Lujienne and Lujako.  Whether or not the thieves used enchantments or had a host of friends to assist remains unknown.

This incident repeated the next night when the doctor and smith found that they were now duplicates  of the others'' wife.  The poor husbands had two confused wives pleading that they were the original, the other the imposter.  When the chaos settled, both mens'' houses had also vanished from sight with little more than a patch of dead grass to reveal that the structures had ever stood there.  The next evening two fishermen also found themselves with the bodies of townswomen and an elderly woman who lived a bit aways was seen eating grass while her horse tried to scrawl writing out into the dirt.

This continued for 31 nights straight, after which not a single occupant of the village remained in their original bodies before the thieves meddled in the town''s affairs.  All 138 inhabitants had been swapped once or several times and not so much as a tent remained to live in, so with nothing to stay for, the villagers all parted separate ways, most having their memories eventually restored though not the bodies they had been born in.  Unsurprisingly a guild hall was constructed in the empty clearing not long after, the Seekshadows having looted every nail and plank from the villagers to construct it.

<b>Day 1, trial X47-1:</b>  An exciting new start to an exciting new project.  While affairs continue to sour at home, I feel as though my professional career has taken a great stride.  I am to lead a new project pursuing a promising regenerative medicine I published my first research paper on twenty years ago.  All the enthusiasm of the youthful valedictorian straight out of college is returning, all the hopeless idealism and optimism which too quickly wanes.  Subject #1 (35/female) was administered 100 milligrams of the serum (working name SUNSHINE) and showed a .%051 increase of cell growth for the following 37 minutes 12 seconds.  A small step to what I am sure will become a great project, one which shall propel me, and the future of mankind, to new heights!


<b>Day 12, trial X-53-3:</b>  [ENTRY REDACTED]


<b>Day 23, trial X-67-2:</b>  I should have known better than to think management would not meddle in my affairs, to jab their sticky fingers in my work and micromanage that which they know nothing about.  SUNSHINE was designed with the goal in mind of regenerating cells for faster healing of wounds.  I must admit progress has been slow.  Today’s trial achieved a %.096 increase in cell growth for 58 minutes 2 seconds, well short of the %15.5 I predicted twenty years ago in my paper.  Yet this progress does not satisfy the number-watchers above my authority.  When I gave my report to Tom, I heard back within the hour that marketing latched on to an undesired side effect of SUNSHINE, a mild aphrodisiac effect.  Now they want me to shift my focus to isolating and enhancing that instead!  Such unimaginable shortsightedness, such lack of ambition!  I will persist.  If they want another easy swallowable pink pill to help old men get it up, fine, that is what I will deliver, and I will do it damn well.  All I need to do is raise a few more eyebrows, secure another promotion, and be free to resume my true pursuit.


<b>Day 29, no trial:</b>  The marketing team has officially updated the name of the drug being administered from SUNSHINE to Arousall-XX.  I am not at all happy with this alteration.  As is typical with the big wigs up top with the corner offices, I was given no chance to protest.  I can see the other project leads smirk as I pass by the break room with my morning coffee or to microwave my lunch.  Dr. Lovebringer working on an aphrodisiac, how hilarious!  A joke that somehow fails to make me laugh.  I remind myself that what matters is the sum of the parts, the elements that go into the formula, the numbers and statistics, the precious knowledge gained from the subtleties of physics and chemistry.  These are what truly matter in the end, not the nicknames the primates in marketing plague us with to appeal to the mindless consumerist masses.


<b>Day 37, trial X100-1:</b>  Results are inconclusive.  When administered Arousall-XX, the patient showed some signs of increased libido.  Subject #17 (23/male) was asked to watch a seven minute video on the subject of aeronautics with subliminal imagery of humans engaged in sexual activities flashed by for one frame out of one hundred.  Brainwave scanning revealed increased activity shortly following 57% of these subliminal images with the number of perceived images rising the longer the drug had time to take effect.  However, statistical significance is relatively low compared to previous trials; it is unclear how much Arousall-XX in its current state is currently having on the test subject’s biology.


<b>Day 48, trial X-107-3:</b>  This new formula for Arousall-XX promises some success.  Upon administering the drug on Subject #19 (27/female), effects were detected relatively quickly (2 minutes 37 seconds) with brain scans showing increased arousal.  When asked to view the video on aeronautics, the subject appeared to react only to the subliminal images and paid little interest in the rest of the video.  The patient detected 92% of the images, as astonishing figure that indicates that Arousall-XX provides increased reflexes in addition to effects on the libido.  Subject #19 needed to be forcibly removed from the lab after the trial had finished due to repeated attempts to seduce my staff.  Our intern Max offered to walk her home and keep her safe to be able to respond to any unforeseen effects from the drug.  The next morning Max came in late with a sly grin on his face.  I have not asked, but it seems obvious to me he did more than simply walk her home.


<b>Day 62, trial X-117.1:</b>  Arousall-XX is now being tested with an experimental disbursement technology aimed distribute the drug throughout the body more evenly.  Personally I see little need for this.  I believe this is Raj’s way to push his nanodrone experiments into a project with a larger budget.  I fought against this decision, but of course the boss disagreed with me, as that fat bastard Tom always does.  Despite this, I must confess that his nanodrones are extremely effective, dispersing the drug throughout the body and brain within mere seconds (2.57 to 4.81).  Subject #21 (19/male) detected an astonishing 99% of the subliminal images hidden within the aeronautics video.  Upon conclusion of the trial, he quickly ran to the bathroom.  I followed him inside to take notes to hear the sounds of furious self-pleasuring which lasted nearly two hours, a full hour longer than Arousall-XX was designed for.  There are too many variables unaccounted for, management pushing too much into this experiment at once, no time for me to analyze my data and properly lay out experiments.  This project is quickly slipping out of my control.


<b>Day 71, trial X-129-4:</b>  I was not present for this trial so this entry may be light on details.  I took the day off to finalize my divorce papers.  It is relieving to finally have that ugly ordeal finally taken care of and allow me to focus on my work.  Max administered the trial in my place, his first time running solo.  In the afternoon I received a phone call from Tom saying there was an accident, that Max had accidentally given the subject the placebo water bottle and instead drank the water containing Arousall-XX himself.  I was told he began to sweat and rushed home sick, and without any more of the substance synthesized the test subject returned home without ever starting the trial.  I regret believing Max was ready for this responsibility.  This just shows how vital I am to the well being of this experiment.


<b>Day 73, no trial.</b>  Max has not reported for work in two days and no one has been able to contact him.  Tom had the police check up on his apartment.  They found the front door unlocked with nobody inside.  The officers filed a missing person’s report on our behalf.


<b>Day 76,  trial X-143-9:</b>  [ENTRY REDACTED]


<b>Day 77, trial X-148-1:</b>  Some dimwitt in management told Tom to have me to run today’s trial with two subjects at once.  I don’t know how many times I have told them that we need to isolate variables first, but with all the attention this project is receiving every manager wants to dip their greedy hands in, to claim some piece of its success and bargain an extra luxury car worth of wages into their annual salary.  I had no choice but to proceed.  Subject #25 (23/male) and Subject #26 (23/female) were entirely unfamiliar with the other aside from being graduate students in the same university.  Both reported long term relationships with infrequent sexual encounters.  Both subjects detected 100% of the sexual images in the aeronautics video for the first two minutes and brain scans revealed an immense arousal in each participant.  Two minutes and fifteen seconds into the trial, both subjects completely lost interest in the video and began to fondle one another.  By the third minute the two subjects had undressed the other and depicted a strong desire to mate.

My assistants looked in, concerned, and suggested that we terminate the trial early.  I gave the order to do nothing and scolded them for failing to collect data.  We are professionals, after all, designing a drug meant to enhance the libido, and must be prepared to watch objectively to see how subjects react.  Even once the aeronautics video concluded, the two continued to engage in unrestrained intercourse, allowing us only long enough to move them into a spare room to finish performing their actions and allow us to clean the laboratory from fluids they left behind.  4 hours and 12 minutes elapsed since the administration of Arousall-XX before the subjects had exhausted themselves and came to their senses, understanding what the two had done.  The female subject threatened to sue and shut us down for ethics violations, but I have no doubt our lawyers will find a way to settle.

<b>Day 79, no trial:</b>  The police have located Max.  Someone matching Max’s description was discovered in a strip club on the east side of town, called in by a patron who happened to see a poster with his face on a community bulletin just outside.  When questioned, Max was said to be going by the name “Maxine” and at first glance appeared female, or at least androgynous by displaying the faint outline of female breasts and a slender waist.  Maxine claimed to have spent the past several days in a confused haze until instinctively finding some measure of refuge and familiarity in the club.  All of the sex appeal “just felt right” in her own words.  Is this truly our missing intern?  Max will be returning to the lab tomorrow and I intend to find some answers.', 339)

<b>Day 80, no trial:</b>  Initial genetic testing confirms that Maxine is indeed our Max.  I never would have guessed it myself.  Maxine’s hair has visibly grown five inches, his trend of early pattern male baldness completely reversed.  Max no longer has any facial hair, and it seems to me even that his facial structure has reconfigured somewhat into a more feminine skeletal structure.  Max’s voice has risen considerably.  I wanted to learn more about the other apparent changes to Max’s body and convinced him to remove his shirt for us.  Although he protested, I threatened to terminate his internship and refuse to sign any future letters of recommendation, an unpleasant action that I felt was necessary for my research.  

Max does appear to have the beginnings of female breasts, A cup at best, easily hidden by a baggy t-shirt or lab coat.  My curiosity piqued, I demanded Max to remove his pants and underwear which took additional means of persuasion.  While still visible, Max’s male genitalia has been greatly diminished, and underneath his testicles I discovered something not even he had, a small slit in the manner of a vagina.  What has Arousall-XX done to his body and why?  How deep does his feminization go?  I wanted more--xrays, blood and urine samples, but at this point Max broke into tears and fled from me.  Not wanting to put my reputation or my project at risk, I permitted him to leave unimpeded.  On the way home I heard our receptionist chatting about how she thought he looked really cute.

Just before going to bed tonight I received a text message from one of the techies saying that Max’s DNA registers as either male or female depending on where the sample was taken from.  Not only that, but some early samples that returned male in the morning returned female when re-tested in the evening, yet not a single instance of the reverse.  Very bizarre.  I suspect Raj’s nanodrones are responsible for this.  I plan to confront him in the morning.


<b>Day 81, no trial:</b>  I talked Raj first thing in the morning, surprising him by sitting in his office chair as he walked in with his morning cup of tea.  He confessed to me under repeated questioning that his nanodrones were devised as a personal experiment, a way to simulate female hormone production as well as trigger moderate bone and muscle readjustment.  He told me he had been smuggling some of the drones home every night and administering them to his girlfriend.

Raj reported that the nanodrones have the same effect on his lady friend as they had on Max, increasing her breast size from B to D cups within the span of a week along with more pronounced and idealized body curves.  He then broke down and sobbed to me that shortly after her changes, she had cheated on him with a friend, her boss, and the mailman yet claimed to have little remembrance of any of the encounters.  Raj begged and asked for me to not tell management.  I replied that I would “think about it based on his continued cooperation.”  This knowledge may prove a future bargaining chip.  Despite her perversions, Raj is a brilliant scientist and will be a vital asset in my career development.

<b>Day 82, no trial:</b>  This morning Max stole a dose of Arousall-XX from the supply cabinet and self-administered himself with 500 milligrams of the drug before walking out of the laboratory without a word.  No one saw this happen; we know only of this after checking security footage once Max’s absence was noticed.  No doubt the company will sic the lawyers and police alike on the idiot boy.  No test subject has been administered such a high dosage.  What this will do to Max can only be speculated upon.  Should Max be located, I predict the drug’s effects will be complete, leaving behind little of Max and a lot more of Maxine.  I can find no justification of his intent other than a wish to finish what his original accident had started.  I advised police to search brothels and strip clubs first; no doubt Maxine will find herself in a lustful frenzy for at least the next full week based on projections of existing data on subjects #21 through #28.


<b>Day 84,  trial X-171-1:</b>  [ENTRY REDACTED]


<b>Day 87, trial X-179-6:</b>  It feels good to be able to focus on my work once again after the chaos of the past several weeks.  Tom’s boss threatened to scrap the project and destroy our research, worried about the legal implications if what we do were revealed to the public by Max or a dissenting employee.  However, the CEO himself intervened and insisted on continuing our project.  Not only that but he has raised our monthly budget by 350% and doubled all of our personal salaries on the Arousall-XX project.  I hear our marketing department is already busy at work preparing advertisements for our mysterious wonder drug that can do everything from cure male pattern baldness, increase breast size, increase reflexes and stamina, all on top of its original intent of simply enhancing one’s sex drive.

Today’s trial involved giving subject #29 (25/male) 500 milligrams of Arousall-XX to mimic Max’s self-administration on day 82.  We decided to forego the aeronautics video and subliminal imagery altogether; at this point it seems a nonfactor in whatever it is management hopes to market this drug as.  Over the course of a mere thirty minutes the subject began to self-pleasure himself, tearing off all of his clothing and began to leap at myself and my staff until he was restrained in a padded room.   7 minutes 13 seconds after administration subject #29 began to show signs of feminization right before our very eyes, visibly growing breast tissue and losing body mass from 86.1 kilograms to a mere 55.3 only 20 minutes 53 seconds after administration.  By 29 minutes 13 seconds the subject appeared 100% female complete with visible and presumably fully functional genitalia.  Genetic testing revealed 100% female DNA.  Activity throughout the lab ground to halt as our entire research department watched the live recording of the changes and twelve hours of tireless self-pleasuring.  Arousal-XX continues to astound us all.  For the first time in months I felt a mild depression upon returning to an empty bed.


<b>Day 92, no trial:</b>  Today my department was informed that subjects #25 and #26, the couple from trial X-148-1, have been arrested for indecent exposure.  Subject #25 (23/female, formerly male) appears to have changed sex in a manner identical to Subject #29 (25/female, formerly male) did.  However, we were told that the two were able to seduce all officers present on duty in the facility, luring them into following them into the jail cells and locking them inside.  This was accomplished despite showing at outward display of diminished intelligence (“bimbos” is a term often repeated in the official reports.)  I can only assume that the any act of intelligence loss is deployed as a trick to lower the guard of any challengers, but with both victims out of custody I have no chance to examine their behaviors myself.

To make matters worse, several of the staff who were exposed to Subject #29 (25/female, formerly male) did not report to work today.  Eyewitness reports from neighbors claim that beautiful women were seen leaving from their houses and apartments.  One of my assistant’s wives claimed she woke up next to a “blonde supermodel looking girl” instead of her husband and chased her out of the apartment with a kitchen knife.  This amount of public exposure is growing dangerous.  Tom and his superiors are growing nervous, demanding overtime from us all and a new round of faustian non-disclosure agreements.  As tension grows I find myself more and more determined to see Arousall-XX through to the end.  We’re on the verge of something world-changing, I can feel it.


<b>Day 94, no trial.</b>  Goddess damn it all!  Tom called me in just after I began to settle into my office to tell me that I was to be reassigned to our antifreeze project across the build starting Monday.  I was told to spend the remainder of the week training my replacement, Cassandra.  What bullshit!  He explained to me that my assistants and coworkers have been complaining about my behavior as of late and ask for my removal.  I know what’s going on here.  I can smell it from a mile away.  Cassandra wants to steal my position and claim all the credit for herself.  She won’t, not while I’m still here.

I went to see her during lunch for a friendly chat.  When she wasn’t looking I slipped 1000 milligrams of Arousall-XX into her coffee. I then pretended to pick up on an urgent phone call from my team and rushed out of her office.  Several minutes later three security guards rushed past me.  The contamination warning alarms were triggered and kicked in automated safety measure, sealing is all in our respective departments for the next thirteen hours.  I saw nothing myself, but evidently Cassandra ambushed the first three security guards and leapt on them, wrestling them to the ground with reported inhuman strength and having her way with all three at the same time.  The sex-altering effects spread to all three men within minutes, posing an even greater threat to security.

I need to have another chat with Raj to figure out why his nanodrones are now seemingly leaping from subject to subject.  It took two dozen guards in hazmats suits and armed with tasers to contain the situation.  A this point the CEO finally called for all video feeds of the incident to be severed, leaving the rest of the facility in the dark as to what was going on.  As none of us were able to leave the laboratory until well past midnight, the upcoming day has been declared an impromptu holiday, conveniently allowing new security measures to be installed and replacement guards hired.   I will continue to do whatever it takes to see Arousall-XX hit the market, no matter the consequences.  It will take some time for Tom to find a replacement for Cassandra, so for now my position remains secure.  I feel no regret for what I have done.  The world could do with one less Cassanda and three fewer hired goons.


<b>Day 95,  trial X-196-3:</b>  [ENTRY REDACTED]


<b>Day 96, trial X-199-1:</b>  Time is running short.  My staff and I can feel it.  Rumor has it that after day 94’s incident we’re all getting the axe, that the lawyers with their cushiony paperwork pushing jobs can’t keep up with the great strides we have been making.  Today’s trial on subject #34 (male/34), subject #35 (female/49) and subject #36 (male/22) have proven that 250 milligrams of Arousall-XX is more than sufficient to transform all ages and and sexes into voluptuous females of roughly age 25.  Of particular note, however, is that subject #35 seemed to gain unquestionable authority over the other two, quickly assuming a position of leadership.  Arousall-XX appears to have another hidden trick, inspiring loyalty to an individual I have nicknamed the “mother.”  What made Subject #35 assume this role, I do not know, though I intend to run additional trials to isolate the cause.


<b>Day 97, no trial.</b>  Grave news.  Our CEO has finally revealed his cowardice.   He is pulling the plug on the project.  Everyone involved is to be distributed to various corporate branches around the world where none of us can talk or collaborate.  I refuse to let some fat bureaucrats halt our glorious research!  

I partook in the greatest decision of life today.  Amongst the chaos of my coworkers cleaning out their desks and making sure all of their chemicals, equipment, records, and assets were fully accounted for, I donned a hazmat suit and slipped a highly concentrated, powdered version of Arousall-XX into the ventilation system.  It is an strange feeling knowing the fate of all the faces you have worked under, alongside, and above for the past five years will soon be permanently altered.  I proceeded to evacuate the laboratory and managed to sign out of the front desk just before I heard the alarms go off.  I looked back to see the window shutters seal and pneumatically sealable doors close.  I carried with me eight terabytes of research data and two kilograms of Arousall-XX in my purse, slinking past the usual process of having my bags checked by security.

I returned to my house just long enough to gather all my most personal belongings.  Tonight I am a woman gone rogue.  I must vanish from the system.  It is only a matter of time before the security footage is looked over and my actions revealed to authorities, though my distraction should give me at least a few days of a head start.  More and more do I understand that the ones infected and transformed by Arousall-XX are the lucky ones, to be able to cast aside all the pettiness of office politics and the slow strangling of relationships, to live free and unrestricted, humanity finally unified under one sisterhood with one simple pursuit, that of simple pleasure.  At times i regret not being with my beautiful sisters, but I bear the burden of a greater purpose that I must now see through to the end.', 340)

<b>Day N-1, trial B-1:</b>  I am tired of waiting, of hiding.  For every night in the past three months I have found a new sleazy hotel to spend the night in (those which accept cash with no question asked) in fear that the police, driven on by the lawyers I once found it so easy to hide behind, will find and arrest me.  They were always scum, but at least they were scum on my side.  No longer.

I do not know what remains of the company.  From what little I have pieced together, my little stunt resulted in %94.7 of the facility succumbing to the effects of Arousall-XX, all employees save a few unlucky scientists out performing field work and the highest levels of management including the CEO himself.  I was not expecting such drastic results, but the more I think about it all, the more I regret that the figure fell short of 100%.

This afternoon I decided to resume my research.  I am alone now in this this great burden.  I no longer have millions of dollars of top notch equipment to work with, no longer have the ability to isolate the variables as a more idealistic me has so long striven for.  It is enough for me now to resume my experiments.  Today I slipped some Arousall-XX into a pitcher of water at a table in a coffee shop and observed the effects on a group of young male college students from a safe distance.  I watched as they transformed into women and began to pounce on the other confused and lustful patrons.  Thankfully my reserves of Arousall-XX have not lost their potency throughout weeks of storage in cheap hotel mini-refrigerators.  Unfortunately, today I was not as lucky as in times past.  I underestimated one of my subjects.  She managed to grab me by the shoulders and slip her tongue into my mouth before the barista managed to shove her away, attracting her attention and falling to her strength sprawled on the counter as she tore away his undergarments.  I fear I too have finally been infected.  Already as I write I begin to feel desire swell within me, my youthful urges returning.  Every man or woman I walk past catches my gaze, my mind flashing images of them between my legs.  I know Arousall-XX better than any and have so far been able to resist its effects.


<b>Day N-4:</b>  My infection is worse than I feared, yet I cannot truly find myself disappointed of my changes.  I find the weight of my years withering away, wrinkles along my eyes and jowls smoothening and vanishing.  I find my gaze lingering on all I come across--male, female, it matters little to me, all calls out to me to touch, to stroke, to suck and lick… Many hours have I spent tonight on this hotel’s adult pay-per-view channels, how many times I have felt compelled to call room service and pounce on whatever cute boy or girl knocks gently outside, to share the gift of my drenched flower and satisfy my great urges.  My chest has swollen, my breasts tighter and firmer, my age regressing to an idealized me straight out of college and finding her way in the world emotionally as well as sexually.   Despite all these great temptations, I do remain in control of my mental faculties.  I have a mission to fulfill and time is running short!


<b>Day N-7:</b>  As luck would have it, I bumped into Raj today.  The slippery bastard managed to isolate himself during my stunt on day 97 and managed to escape the laboratory by hacking into the mainframe and releasing the locks on his office’s emergency window shutters.  Clever boy.  The sod is frightened to no end and wants to return home to Mumbai.  

I asked him about the nature of his nanodrones, why they could jump from one host to another.  He confessed to me that he had seen to no success with them for the first seven months of their development, and Tom had been threatening to cut off his funding and demote him.  Shortly before he managed to get them included into trial X-117.1, Raj decided in sheer desperation to imbue them with the particles found in the blood samples of a citizen of that strange town of Sunnyglade.  

How DARE he?  Those damned particles are the biggest headache any man or woman of science could possibly encounter in their career.  They follow no known laws of mathematics and refuse to be observed except in the most select of times.  Dr. Hallsworth drove himself mad trying to devise some basic law to devise their nature, eventually driving to Sunnyglade to interview the woman who had provided the sample.  Hallsworth was never heard from again.  How could Raj possible think he could control them once he mixed them in with his nanodrones?  There is a reason myself and others have nicknamed the particles “raw magic”.  Despite my fury at his idiocy, I kept my cool until I extracted all the information I could.  When our checks came, I slipped some Arousall-XX into my cheesecake and shoved it into Raj’s mouth, to his great surprise.

I stormed off and waited outside for Raj to emerge.  And emerge she did, a gorgeous woman with long black hair and wide hips, the epitome of a Bollywood superstar.  Testing some rough hypothesis about what causes an infectee to become a “mother”, I commanded Rajw to to drop to her knees and pant like a bitch in heat.  She performed exactly as asked, showing to hesitation or shame.  I laid out a series of humiliating tasks, rolling on her back and whimpering like a mutt, licking her own nipples and expose herself in a ways no sane man or woman would otherwise agree to.  Raj obediantly fulfilled all of my requests, including my final request to throw herself at the first police to respond to our strange public spectacle and provide me a means to slip away unnoticed.  I have no doubt that through my own accidental infection, I have become a Mother.


<b>Day N-15:</b>  With only 500 milligrams of Arousall-XX remaining and no capability to synthesize more, I find myself running short on options.  From what I have gathered from the newspapers, radio, and television specials, I have successfully spread the effects of the drug to over 11,700 individuals across the eastern seaboard.  Entire towns have been transformed, the newspapers say, not a male in sight, every single woman eagerly engaged in endless intercourse with her countless curvaceous sisters.  But then all the articles and broadcasts simply stopped, dismissed as a large scale prank, mere irresponsible journalism by sensationalist reporters.  What lies!  The truth is far stranger and wonderful than any lie they could have ever mustered.  I suspect the hand of the government, perhaps the shadowy Center for Transformation Control and Prevention, slowly moving its gears to face the threat my virus has revealed.  Already I hear rumors of a vaccine in development, so I must remain ever vigilant and swift.

I will not be silenced!  I cannot be stopped!  I cannot!  But I have learned that the nanodrones are finite.  They can only spread so much, deliver Arousall-XX and reconfigure the body’s cells so long before they are drained of power and rendered useless duds and swept away as dust.  My plague will run its course before it can accomplish its final victory without some outside assistance.

It is clear to me that I must follow in the footsteps of Dr. Hallsworth.  I must travel to the town of Sunnyglade itself, to partake in the unholy matrimony of advanced science and so-called supernatural.  I predict the “raw magic” particles can keep Raj’s nanodrones running indefinitely, chaos fueling chaos, pleasure inducing pleasure.  If I am to change the world, to turn the petty and inefficient race of human beings into the perfect life form bound in unity by lust and sisterhood, I must first conquer the town of Sunnyglade and send its transformed citizens, my new loyal army, to every corner of this world to spread my gifts!  

Just think about it, no more Toms in this world, no more CEOs, no more bitter husbands or wives jealous of their partner’s superior career aspects!  No more wars, no more competition, no existence other than the simple happy bliss of endless intercourse!  At first I felt ashamed to write this, but since my gift has been exposed to the world and changed my own physiology, II have laid with twenty two men and seven women during my run from the law, personally spreading the virus to them all!  Twenty nine more giggly loving souls freed from the turmoils of this miserable planet, loyal to my every command!  With each partner my lust only grows.  Sunnyglade will not be able to resist me.  I am the plague mother, the angel of love and peace!
